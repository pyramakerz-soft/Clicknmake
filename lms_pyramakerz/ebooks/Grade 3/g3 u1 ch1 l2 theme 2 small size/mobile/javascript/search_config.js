When Adam got home, he was                                                                     curious to learn more, so he looked                                                                     up information about pandas.

The next day, He decided to tell his             friends about what he had learned.             Together, they came up with an idea             to add these animals to their             wildlife model. They wanted to             show ways to protect them and             make sure they have everything             they need to survive.

Choose an Endangered Animal: Pick one or                   two endangered animals you like (e.g.,                   panda, tiger, sea turtle).                 2.  Add Pictures: Draw or print pictures of the                   animals and glue them onto your poster.                 3.  Write About the Animal: Add a few                   sentences about the animals. Where do they                   live? What do they eat? Why are they                   important?                 4.  Explain the Danger: Write what makes them                   endangered. Is it habitat loss, hunting,                   pollution, or something else?                 5.  Add Ideas to Help: Write or draw what                   people can do to protect these animals. For                   example, planting trees, cleaning up litter,                   or making safe spaces for them.                 6.
