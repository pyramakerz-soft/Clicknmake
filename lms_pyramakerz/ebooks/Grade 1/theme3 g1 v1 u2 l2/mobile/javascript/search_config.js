Let’s remember what our inclusive swing needs:            Big and wide — so a wheelchair can fit comfortably.           A ramp that moves — so kids using wheelchairs can           roll on and off easily.            The ramp becomes the front gate — it lifts up to           close safely in front, so we don’t need to take it off           when the swing moves!            Great teamwork, everyone! Keep thinking and           building like engineers!               46","Builder            Create and build both an accessible swing and a regular swing, and include them in your           playground model.
