          Every child deserves a fun, safe place to play—regardless of their abilities. Yet many playgrounds
          still fall short of being truly inclusive. In this theme, students will step into the roles of young
          engineers, coders, and designers as they imagine and create a smarter, more accessible
          playground where everyone is welcome.
          Using the power of technology, coding, and AI, students will explore how intelligent design can
          remove barriers and support all children. They will build simple electric circuits and integrate
          features like sound alerts, and moving components—enhanced with basic programming and
          AI-driven logic to adapt to different needs. These hands-on activities will teach students how
          circuits, motors, and sensors work together and how coding can bring their designs to life.

          Throughout the project, students will dive into foundational coding concepts such as sequencing,
          algorithms, and conditional statements, learning how to give precise instructions to control
          devices and respond to real-world challenges. They'll even begin to explore how AI can
          recognize patterns and help create more responsive, inclusive technologies.

          This project connects directly to Sustainable Development Goals 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and
          11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), inviting students to consider how empathy, fairness,
          and smart technologies can transform public spaces. By the end of the theme, students will
          have not only designed and built a model of an inclusive, tech-enabled playground—but also
          discovered how coding and AI can help build a more inclusive future for everyone.
