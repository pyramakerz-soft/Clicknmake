What program can help us design it?”            Adam: “Tinkercad! We’ve used it before!”            Laila: “We can add ramps, swings, and everything we need!”                                            16","Let’s              Think!

What do they remind you of?              •  Use the shapes to make something that could help kids on the playground — like a                sign, a path, or a fun place to play.              •  Glue the shapes on a the next paper to show your idea.              •  Color your picture with bright colors to make it easy to see.

They only have length and                width.             •   3D Shapes: These shapes are not flat! They have                length, width, and height, like cubes, spheres, and                pyramids.            To find out how long, wide, or tall something is, we           use tools like a ruler or measuring tape. We measure in           centimeters (cm) or meters (m).                          Builder            Make a small chair on Tinkercad for families and people to sit on in the playground.
