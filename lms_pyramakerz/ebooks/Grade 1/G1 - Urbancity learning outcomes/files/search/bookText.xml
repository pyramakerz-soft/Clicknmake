                           Identify and name key technologies present in smart cities.


                           Describe how smart cities use resources wisely, keep things
                           clean, and use less energy to help the Earth.


                           Recognize and make basic two-dimensional shapes (e.g. Circles,
                           squares) and three-dimensional shapes (e.g., cubes, spheres).


                           Recognize the Tinkercad interface and become familiar with its
                           basic tools and functions.

                           Compare and contrast the vertices, edges, and faces of
                           di erent three-dimensional shapes.


                           Recognize basic road safety rules and understand how they
                           help keep us safe while traveling.

                           Identify forces and explore simple machines, like ramps, using
                           measuring tools to understand dimensions.

                           Understand the basics of electricity and create simple circuits.


                           Recognize and understand the basics of algorithmic thinking by
                           following simple step-by-step instructions to solve problems.


                           Evaluate the e ectiveness of the tra c light models in
                           demonstrating how to solve road accidents at crossroads and
                           smart alarm in cross section.
