                   Where we merge your existing knowledge with exciting new discoveries.


            2      Inquiry-Based Learning!

                   Let’s Think!
                   In this section, students will brainstorm and explore possible solutions to specific
                   problems. This encourages critical thinking and creativity as they consider various
                   approaches.

                   Explorer’s Toolkit
                   Here, students will dive deeper into the topic. They will engage with curated
                   videos, articles, educational games, and hands-on experiments to broaden their
                   understanding and spark curiosity.

                   DIY Lab
                   It’s part of the explore, students will undertake hands-on projects where they will
                   design, build, and test their own creations. They will apply scientific principles,
                   use technology and engineering skills, explore artistic concepts, and utilize
                   mathematical reasoning.

                   Screen Lessons
                   Students will watch videos that explain key concepts in an engaging and
                   accessible way.


            3      Problem-Based Learning:

                   •  Introducing the problem:
                      Students will join a journey to tackle real-world environmental challenges.
                      Through hands-on activities and engaging tasks, they will apply their knowledge
                      and skills to discover innovative solutions.
                   •  Apply the Engineering Design Process (EDP):
                      Students will use a structured approach to define problems, conduct research,
                      generate ideas, prototype solutions, test, evaluate, and refine their designs.

                   •  The Scientific Method:
                      Students will follow a systematic process of inquiry—making observations,
                      forming hypotheses, conducting experiments, analyzing data, and drawing
                      conclusions—to develop a deeper understanding of scientific concepts and
                      problem-solving. In doing so, they will incorporate the CER framework to
                      present their scientific claims, provide evidence from their experiments, and
                      explain their reasoning behind the conclusions they draw.
