                                     Connect a motor to a battery in a circuit. Then, switch
                                     the polarity and observe how the motor's movement
                                     changes.

                What is the primary function of a diode?

                A) To store electricity.
                B) To control current ow in one direction.
                C) To generate heat.
                D) To create light.

                In a diode, electrons ow from the:
                A) Cathode to anode.
                B) Anode to cathode.
                C) Top to bottom.
                D) Left to right.

                Now, connect the circuit with
                the diode included and observe
                how it aects the motor's
                rotation direction.

                Record your observations.
