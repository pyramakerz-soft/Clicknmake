                          Focus
                          Focus




              Which of the following correctly describes the application of Newton's
              Laws of Motion to the operation of a ride like Tora Tora?

              A) Newton's First Law explains that the ride will remain at rest until an external force
                 (motor) is applied, and the ride will stay in motion until friction or air resistance
                 slows it down.
              B) Newton's Second Law states that the force of the motor will cause the ride to
                 accelerate, depending on the ride’s weight and the force exerted.
              C) Newton's Third Law explains that for every action (force exerted by the motor),
                 there is an equal and opposite reaction (the ride's movement).
              D) All of the above.


              How do gears aect the motion of an amusement park ride like Tora Tora?
              A) Gears increase the speed of the ride by reducing torque.
              B) Gears allow the motor to provide more force to the ride by decreasing its speed.
              C) Gears control the balance of the ride by regulating its acceleration.
              D) Gears have no impact on the ride’s movement, they are only for aesthetic purposes.


              Which statement best explains how changing the gear ratio on the Tora
              Tora ride impacts the motion?
              A) Increasing the gear ratio makes the ride spin faster by reducing torque.
              B) Decreasing the gear ratio makes the ride spin slower by increasing torque.
              C) Changing the gear ratio does not aect the speed or force of the ride.
              D) The gear ratio only aects the appearance of the ride and not its actual movement.






                                                    1.  Newton's First Law (Inertia)
                                                       An object stays at rest or keeps moving unless a
                                                       force acts on it.

                                                    2.  Newton's Second Law (Force and Acceleration)
                                                       Acceleration depends on the force applied and the
                                                       object's mass. The equation is:
                                                       F = m × a

                                                    3.  Newton's Third Law (Action and Reaction)
                                                       For every action, there’s an equal and opposite
                                                       reaction.

              Adjust the gear ratio in the tora tora model to make the ride spin faster
              or slower.
              Record observations on how the gear ratio aects speed and torque.
