As the world’s population continues to grow at an unprecedented rate, we face the           challenges of finding new resources and expanding our habitats. Earth's natural resources           are becoming increasingly strained, and the need for sustainable living spaces has never           been more urgent. But what if there’s a solution beyond Earth? What if the key to our           survival lies on another planet?           You’ve just joined Mission Control at NASA,           part of a top-tier team of engineers and           scientists dedicated to one of the most           thrilling and vital challenges in space           exploration. Mars, the Red Planet, has           always fascinated humanity, and now it may           be our next hope for a future beyond Earth.           However, Mars is not an easy place to           explore—the terrain is harsh, the           environment is unpredictable, and dangers           like dust storms and radiation await at every turn. But despite the risks, the stakes couldn’t           be higher.            Recently, our satellite station, Mars Base Alpha, detected something unusual:           “We’ve picked up signs of rising temperatures and unstable gases in a volcanic region.           There may be geothermal activity or underground eruptions forming—but we need more           data to be sure.”           This could be the key to determining if Mars can support life—and we need your help to           uncover it.            Your Mission:            As a mission engineer, your job is to design, build, and program a Mars Rover that can           explore the Martian surface, search for signs of life, and gather the critical data needed to           determine if Mars could one day support human colonies.            Your rover must be smart—it needs to:             •  Navigate and move across the rugged                Martian terrain, exploring regions                that may be too dangerous for human                explorers              •  Analyze the Martian atmosphere for                hazardous gases that could affect future                missions              •  Investigate temperature variations, which                may signal volcanic activity or other environmental factors                                                                                                                  3","•  Collect and send valuable data back to Earth, while ensuring the rover can return                 safely to base           This is a race against time, and you’re at the forefront of this mission. The future of space           exploration—and the potential survival of the human race—depends on the rover you           build. Mars could be humanity's next home, and you're the one to help unlock its secrets.           Driving Questions:            As you work on your rover, keep these questions in mind—because every decision you           make will lead you closer to the answers:           1 .  How can we help astronauts detect dangerous volcanic activity on Mars?            2 .  What rover design works best on Mars' rocky, unpredictable terrain?            3 .  How can sensors and code help us understand what’s happening below the Martian              surface?            4 .  What tools and inventions can we create to solve challenges faced during space              missions?            5 .  How does 3D design contribute to creating innovative solutions for space              exploration?            6 .  What skills do real NASA engineers use when working as a team to solve complex              problems?           Ready to Launch?                Let’s              Think!             What makes Mars different from Earth, and why is it so challenging to explore?                                                 4","How does artificial intelligence help scientists make sense           of the huge amount of data collected from Mars?

Mars and Earth are both rocky planets, but they differ           greatly in key ways:             •  Size: Mars is about half the size of Earth.              •  Gravity: Mars has only 38% of Earth’s gravity, so                objects on Mars weigh much less.             •  Atmosphere: Earth’s thick atmosphere supports                life and protects us from harmful radiation. In                contrast, Mars has a thin atmosphere, mainly                made of carbon dioxide, which offers little protection.                6","•  Water: Earth has liquid water on its surface, which is essential for life. Mars, however,                has no liquid water—only frozen water in the form of ice.              •  Temperature: Mars experiences colder temperatures than Earth, with extreme                temperature swings between day and night.            These differences make Mars a challenging place to explore, and they highlight the need           for advanced technology to overcome these obstacles in future missions.

Hey friends                                                     let’s wrap up!              Law 1: Gravity Ratio Rule            The weight of an object on another planet = Weight on           Earth × Planet’s gravity ratio.

Hi, Mars Rover                                                      Scientist!               Here’s what you learned about AI and exploring Mars:             •  AI spots patterns: Just like you trained your                model to recognize rocks, craters, and flat areas,                AI can quickly analyze Mars images and identify                important features.              •  AI keeps rovers safe: By detecting dangerous                terrain, AI helps real rovers avoid obstacles and                continue exploring without damage.              •  AI improves with practice: The more data AI gets, the more accurate it becomes—just                like when you adjusted your model to make it better.             •  Endless possibilities: In the future, AI could help scientists find ice, detect dust storms,                or even identify signs of past water on Mars.                      Mastermind             Imagine you're part of a real Mars mission team. Scientists don’t just send rovers           randomly—they plan where they want it to go and what data it should collect.            Now it’s your turn to be the mission designer!           Your Task:            At home, sketch your own version of a Mars Exploration Mat.

Labels or symbols that show what the rover will find in each zone.           A starting base and an end base where the rover returns safely.            Optional: Add hazards like radiation zones, or helpful areas like farming domes.                                                                                                                             9","                                                       10","Outstanding job,                                                Mission Engineers!
