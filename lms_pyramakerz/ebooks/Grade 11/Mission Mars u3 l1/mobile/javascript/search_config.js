Why is water essential for humans, plants, and animals to survive?                     If most water on Mars is frozen or underground, how could astronauts find it and store it           for use in their shelter?

Water is essential for life—humans, plants, and           animals rely on it for survival. It helps regulate           temperature, transport nutrients, and support           growth. Without water, living organisms cannot           survive.            On Mars, water is scarce, but it exists in           frozen forms, like at the poles or underground.           Astronauts will need to extract or recycle           this water to stay hydrated and grow food for           survival. Understanding how water works on           Mars is crucial for creating sustainable habitats.                                                                                                                51","Assessment                          Apprentice            Part 1: Multiple Choice Questions            1 .
