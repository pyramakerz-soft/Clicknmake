With the health check-up underway, a sudden malfunction of the heart rate machine                threatened to derail the process. Undeterred by the setback, Adam and Laila, two curious                and resourceful students, proposed a solution: to step into the role of biomedical engineers                and x the machine themselves. Inspired by their initiative, Mrs. Sara encouraged the                entire class to join in the challenge, transforming a potential roadblock into an exciting                opportunity for learning and collaboration.                        Mrs. Sara : Alright, everyone                To x the device we’ll follow                the engineering design steps:                 dene the problem,                brainstorm solutions, design,                and test.

A) It is pumped to the lungs for oxygenation.               B) It is pumped to the body's cells.               C) It is stored in the heart chambers.               D) It is ltered by the kidneys.                What is the role of the heart valves?                A) To pump blood.               B) To carry blood throughout the body.               C) To prevent blood from owing backward.               D) To exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide.
