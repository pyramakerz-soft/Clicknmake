I'll guide you               through it.                 Here’s how it works:                1. You have a list of cards. Each card has                   an object or symbol representing a                   specic season (spring, summer,                   autumn, or winter).                2. For each card, you'll reveal the object,                   and you’ll decide where it should go on                   the seasons tree (spring, summer,                   autumn, or winter).                3. Based on your choice, you will \"take\" a                   token and place it in the appropriate                   spot on the tree.
