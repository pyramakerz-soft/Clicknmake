A) A type of wheel with teeth.               B) A at piece of wood.               C) A ball that rolls.               D) A type of rope.                 What happens when two gears are connected?               A) They spin in the same direction.               B) They do not move.               C) They spin in opposite directions.               D) They break apart.                 Why are gears important in machines?               A) They help machines work faster and easier.               B) They make machines heavier.               C) They make machines slower.               D) They stop machines from working.
