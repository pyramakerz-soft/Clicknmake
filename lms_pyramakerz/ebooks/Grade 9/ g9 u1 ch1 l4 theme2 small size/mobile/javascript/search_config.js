A) To froth milk.               B) To dispense hot water.               C) To control the water ow through the coee.               D) To heat the steam.                Why is it important for the brew boiler and steam boiler to operate at               dierent temperatures in an espresso machine?                A) To save energy.               B) To ensure the espresso is brewed at the correct temperature while                   allowing milk to be steamed eectively.               C) To allow for faster coee production.
