             The next morning, Laila met Adam to tell him
             about the project.

             Laila began, "Adam, I’ve been working on a
             really exciting project! I’ve built a prototype
             for a robotic arm with Ali"
             Adam, curious, asked, "That sounds
             awesome! What’s the next step?"

             Laila replied, "Now that the prototype is
             done, we need to design a hand that can
             move and hold things.


             Adam nodded. "That’s a great plan. What
             should we use to design it?"


             Laila thought for a moment and said, "What
             about Tinkercad? We can create the design
             there, and then ask Mrs. Sara to print it for
             us with her 3D printer."

             Adam, excited by the idea, smiled. "That’s a
             smart approach. Let’s get started!"

              Laila went to school and asked

              The teacher was happy to hear
