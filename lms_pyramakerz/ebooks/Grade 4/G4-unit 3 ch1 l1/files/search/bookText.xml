                         What is coding.                                Use App Inventor to create a

             Ali: "Alright, Laila, we're done!
             You and adam did a great job
             the hand is moving perfectly."
             Laila: "But I feel like we could
             do something more..."


             Laila: "Hmm, oh, I know! What
             if we made it work like Siri,
             where it listens to orders?
             That way, omar could just tell
             the hand what to do, and it
             would move!"

             Ali (excited): "That's a
             brilliant idea, Laila! We can
             create a mobile app so Omar
             can control the arm using his
             voice. Let’s add that to our
             project!"
