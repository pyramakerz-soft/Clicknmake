Understand how the arm acts                                                                         as a lever system.                           Forces can change how things                   Recognize force and torque.                          move, like making objects go                          faster or slower.                    After deciding to build a robot arm to show              how muscles connect to bones, Ali had an idea.              Ali: \"Laila, did you know our muscles work like              levers to move bones? Let me show you.\"              He used a ruler and pencil to demonstrate how              a lever works, explaining that the joints act as              fulcrums and muscles pull to create movement.               Laila (excited): \"So, we can add joints and use              strings as muscles to make the robot arm              move!\"              Ali nodded. \"Exactly! Let’s start building and              test it out.\"                                                                        What do you think happens to the muscles in your                                                                  arm when you bend and straighten it?
