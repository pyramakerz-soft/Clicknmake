                                                                          and Laila decided to go to

                                                                          had noticed something
                                                                          weird.

                                                                          The park’s pond was
                                                                          getting smaller, and the
                                                                          trees were losing their

              Adam: "Laila, have you
              seen how dry the pond is?
              It used to be so full of
              water!"

              Laila: "I know! And look at
              those trees. They should
              still have their leaves. I
              wonder if it has anything
              to do with global
              warming."

             At home, they began to
             learn more about global
             warming and its eects.
             Laila said, ““Global
             warming happens when
             greenhouse gases trap
             heat in the atmosphere.
             That’s why our park is
             changing”


             Adam said, “We should do
             something to help!What if
             we create a project to
             raise awareness and show
             our community how they
             can help?

                 Hello friends! Today, we’re doing a fun experiment to
                 learn about global warming.


                 You’ll need 2 bottles, 2 thermometers, water, vinegar,
                 and baking soda.

                1.  Fill one bottle with water, place a thermometer inside, close it,
                    and put it in the sun.
                2.  In the other bottle, add vinegar, baking soda, and a
                    thermometer, then close it and put it in the sun.



                Write down what you see happening in each bottle and think
                about what it means. Let’s discover together!

              Research other causes of global warming, create a presentation, and share
              it with your class.







              Excellent work so far, everyone!
              Now, let’s combine our ideas to gure out how
              we can measure the eects of climate change.
