How do websites work?                                                Design.                                              The design process includes planning the layout,                                              choosing colors and fonts, and organizing content to                                              create an appealing and user-friendly experience.                                               View.                                               Web Browsers: When a user enters a website's URL in                                              a web browser, the browser sends a request to the                                              server hosting that website. The server then sends                                              back the necessary les for the browser to display                                              the page.                                               Interaction: Users interact with the website by                                              clicking links, lling out forms, and scrolling through                                              content. The design guides these interactions,                                              making it easy for users to nd information or                                              complete tasks online.                                                                          34"];
