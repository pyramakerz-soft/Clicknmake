A) To measure temperature.               B) To detect the presence of water.               C) To control the ow of water.               D) To display water quality.                 What does the digitalWrite(pin, value) function do in Arduino?                A) Reads the state of a digital pin.               B) Sets a digital pin to HIGH or LOW.               C) Initializes the serial communication.               D) Congures a pin as an input.
