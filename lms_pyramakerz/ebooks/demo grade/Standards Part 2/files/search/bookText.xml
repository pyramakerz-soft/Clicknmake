                     What Will
                    Students Do?
                   1. Learn About
                    the Heart and
                    Arrhythmias:
                     Study the
                   anatomy of the
                   heart and how
                      it pumps
                       blood.
                     Understand
                    what causes
                      irregular
                   heartbeats and
                        how
                    pacemakers
                        help.
                    2. Design the
                      Artificial
                    Pacemaker:
                   Use sensors to
                    detect heart
                    rhythms (e.g.,
                       pulse
                      sensors).
                     Program a
                   microcontroller
                   (e.g., Arduino)
                    to analyze the
                    heart rhythm
                     and detect
                    irregularities.
                    Use actuators
                     (e.g., small
                     motors or
                      LEDs) to
                    simulate the
                    pacemaker’s
                      electrical
                     impulses.
                     3. Enhance
                    with Wireless
                    Connectivity:
                   Add a wireless
                    module (e.g.,
                    Bluetooth or
                      Wi-Fi) to
                    transmit heart
                   rhythm data to
                   a computer or
                    mobile app.
                      Create a
                       simple
                     interface to
                     display the
                    data and alert
                      doctors if]]></page><page Index="3"><![CDATA[irregularities

                     4. Test and
                      Improve:
                      Test the
                     pacemaker
                     model with
                     simulated
                    heart rhythms
                    (e.g., using a
                       pulse
                   generator or a
                   simple circuit).
                    Iterate on the
                     design and
                      code to
                      improve
                    accuracy and
                      reliability.

                   Create a glove
                    equipped with
                   flex sensors to
                    detect finger

                   accelerometer
                   to detect hand
                     orientation.

                       Use a
                   microcontroller
                   (e.g., Arduino)
                     to process
                    sensor data
                    and translate
                    gestures into
                   text or speech.

                      Build the
                       Circuit:

                    Connect flex
                     sensors, an
                   accelerometer,
                       and a
                   microcontroller
                    to the glove.

                    Add an LCD
                     display or
                     speaker to
                     output the
                   translated text
                     or speech.

                      Code the
                      System:

                    Write code to
                    read sensor

                    and libraries
                    (e.g., text-to-
                     speech) to
                     output the
                     translation.

                      Test and
                      Improve:

                   Test the glove
                    with different
                     gestures to
                       ensure
                      accurate
                     translation.

                    Iterate on the
                     design and
                      code to
                      improve
                    functionality
                    and usability.

                     it converts
                   speech to text.

                     Design the
                      System:

                       Use a
                   microphone to
                    capture audio
                     input from
                   conversations.

                     Integrate a
                   speech-to-text
                      API (e.g.,

                      convert
                     speech into
                        text.

                     Display the
                     generated
                    subtitles on a
                   screen in real-
                       time.

                      Build the
                     Circuit and
                     Interface:]]></page><page Index="26"><![CDATA[Connect a

                      screen or
                    monitor) to a
                   microcontroller
                       (e.g.,
                    Raspberry Pi)
                    or computer.

                     Develop a
                    user-friendly
                     interface to
                       display
                      subtitles

                   adjust settings
                   (e.g., font size,
                      speed).

                      Code the
                      System:

                    Write code to
                   process audio
                    input, convert
                   speech to text,
                     and display
                     subtitles in
                     real-time.

                        Use
                     conditional
                     statements
                    and APIs to
                       handle
                      different
                     languages,
                    accents, and
                      speech
                      speeds.

                    environments
                      to ensure
                     accuracy.

                      code to
