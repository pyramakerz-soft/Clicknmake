          Objective:  Introduce  the challenge  and inspire  action.
          Teacher Role:
          •Act as the city  leader  and set the stage by presenting  the tourism  problem.
          •Share an engaging  and motivating  script  to get students  thinking  about the challenge.
          Script  Example:  “Ministry team, our city has a rich culture and history, but tourism has been declining.
          Visitors want unique and engaging experiences, especially ones that involve advanced technology. Your task
          is to come up with an innovative attraction that blends our city's cultural heritage with high-tech solutions.
          We need something so amazing that it becomes a must-visit destination. I’m relying on your creativity and
          expertise!”
          Student Role:
          •Listen  actively  to the city  leader’s  speech and get excited  about the challenge.
          •Start thinking  about the cultural  uniqueness  of the city  and how technology  can be integrated.
          Strategy to Implement:
          •Hook: Begin  with  an impactful  scenario  where the city  needs innovative  ideas to boost tourism.
          •Use a motivational  tone to create a sense of urgency  and importance.
          Teacher Tip:  Use visuals  or a video  clip  showcasing  iconic  landmarks  with  a futuristic  twist  to spark
          students’  imagination.





          2. Explore
          Objective:  Encourage  students  to think  broadly  about potential  solutions.
          Teacher Role:
          •Divide  the students  into  groups, each representing  a different  branch of the Ministry  (e.g., Culture,
          Technology,  Tourism).
          •Assign  roles within  the groups  (e.g., leader, note-taker,  presenter).
          Activity:
          •Groups brainstorm  ideas for a new tourist  attraction  that combines  cultural  heritage  with  advanced
          technology.
          •Each group discusses:
                  •   What makes the city  unique  in  terms of cultural  elements,  landmarks,  or history.
                  •   What kinds of experiences  attract modern  tourists  (e.g., immersive,  interactive).
                  •   What high-tech  solutions  could  make tourism  more engaging  (e.g., VR, robotics,  interactive
                      exhibits).
          •Each group presents  a brief  list  of ideas to share with  the class.
          Student Role:
          •Actively  participate  in  brainstorming  sessions,  contributing  their  knowledge  of the city’s  history  and
          modern  tourist  trends.
          •Collaborate  with  team  members  to generate  creative  ideas for integrating  technology  into  the city’s  culture.
          Strategy to Implement:
          •Use brainstorming and mind  mapping to guide  students  as they  explore  possible  solutions.
          •Encourage  creative  thinking  and make sure each group  presents their  findings.
          Teacher Tip:  Use sticky notes or a digital  tool to collect  ideas from  each group, allowing  for quick  review
          and feedback.]]></page><page Index="4"><![CDATA[3. Explain

           Objective:  Narrow down ideas and focus  on the concept of a high-tech  museum.
           Teacher Role:
           •Guide  students  by asking  probing  questions  to help  refine  their  ideas.
                  •    “How can we make history  come alive  for tourists?”
                  •    “What  if  visitors  could  interact  with  our cultural  landmarks  instead  of just looking  at them?”
                  •    “How can technology  transform  traditional  attractions?”
           •Facilitate  a class discussion  to clarify  the vision  of creating  a high-tech  museum that embodies  both
           culture  and technology.
           Activity:
           •After  brainstorming,  students  share their  group results  with  the rest of the class.
           •Engage  in  a class discussion  to explore  which  ideas will  work best, and refine  these ideas into  a cohesive
           museum  concept.
           Student Role:
           •Share and explain  the ideas generated  in  their  groups.
           •Listen  to others’ ideas and collaborate  in refining  them,  while  keeping  the focus  on creating  an immersive,
           tech-driven  museum.
           Strategy to Implement:
           •Use group  sharing followed  by a class discussion to refine  ideas.
           •Encourage  students  to focus on blending  high-tech  solutions  (e.g., AR/VR,  robotics)  with  cultural  heritage.


           4.   Elaborate
           Objective:  Flesh  out the concept of the high-tech  museum  by assigning  specific  roles.
           Teacher Role:
           •Assign  different  focus areas to each group  (e.g., Theme  Development,  Tech Integration,  Visitor
           Experience,  Promotion).
           •Guide  each group with  questions  to help  them  dive  deeper into  their  assigned  area:
                  •    Theme Development: What should  the museum’s  theme  be? Local  culture,  global
                       innovations,  historical  landmarks?
                  •    Tech Integration:  How will  technology  be used to enhance  the visitor  experience
                       (AR/VR,  robotics,  etc.)?
                  •    Visitor Experience:  What kind  of interactive,  engaging  activities  should  be included
                       (hands-on  exhibits,  holograms,  etc.)?
                  •    Promotion:  How will  the museum  be marketed to attract tourists  (social  media,
                       advertising,  partnerships)?
           Activity:
           •Each group works on their  assigned  aspect of the museum’s  concept.
           •After  brainstorming,  each group  prepares a presentation  of their  aspect of the museum.
           Student Role:

           •Collaborate  within  groups to develop  ideas and come up with  creative  solutions.
           •Present their  assigned  section  of the museum  plan to the class.
           Strategy to Implement:
           •Encourage  role-based collaboration where each group  becomes an expert in  a specific  area of
           the project.
           •Use creative tools such  as mind  mapping,  prototyping,  or mockups  to bring  ideas to life.
           Teacher Tip:  Circulate  during  the group work phase to ensure  each group stays on task and offers
           guidance  where needed.]]></page><page Index="5"><![CDATA[Evaluate

          Objective:  Present  the final  museum  plan  and evaluate  the feasibility  of the project.
          Teacher Role:
          •Facilitate  the final  presentations  by each group,  ensuring  they stay focused  on their  assigned  aspect of the
          museum.
          •Provide  feedback after each group presents,  encouraging  improvements  and collaboration.
          •Ask reflective  questions:
                 •   “How feasible  is this  museum  in  real life?”
                 •   “What  makes your museum  different  from  others?”
          Activity:
          •Each group presents  their  part of the high-tech  museum  concept.
          •The class collaborates  to combine  all  aspects into  a unified  proposal.
          Student Role:
          •Present their  section  of the museum  concept clearly  and engagingly.
          •Listen  to feedback from  the class  and the teacher  to improve  and finalize  the museum  concept.
          Strategy to Implement:
          •After  each group  presentation,  allow  for peer feedback.
          •Use a rubric to evaluate  presentations  based on creativity,  feasibility,  and teamwork.
          Teacher Tip:  End with  an inspiring  conclusion,  praising  the students  for their  creativity  and innovation,
          and emphasize  the potential  impact  their  museum  concept could have  on tourism.









          Assessment Criteria:
          •Creativity:  How unique  and engaging  is the proposed idea? (e.g., Does it stand out from  other tourist
          attractions?)
          •Relevance: Does it effectively  highlight  the city’s  culture  and history?  (e.g., How well  does it represent
          local  landmarks  and heritage?)
          •Feasibility:  Can the solution  realistically  be implemented  in  terms of technology  and resources?  (e.g., Is it
          practical?)
          •Collaboration:  Did the group  work effectively  as a team? (e.g., Was the project completed  in a timely  and
          organized  manner?)]]></page><page Index="6"><![CDATA[Lesson Plan
