                                     Before you start designing your own monument, follow
                                     these steps to explore and understand key design
                                     concepts:




                  1.  Explore Existing Monuments:
                     Search Tinkercad’s gallery for 3D models of famous monuments. Look closely at
                     the shapes, balance, and symmetry used in their construction.

                  2.  Break Down the Shapes:
                     Pick a monument and identify the basic shapes used (e.g., cylinders, cubes). See
                     how they combine to create a balanced structure.

                  3.  Quick Shape Challenge:
                     Try creating a simple model by combining and adjusting shapes.

                       I can break down complex monument designs into basic geometric
                       shapes for easier modelling.
                       I understand key architectural design principles like symmetry,
                       proportion, scaling, and how to apply them in my designs.
                       I can apply advanced design principles such as symmetry, proportion,
                       and scaling to accurately model famous monuments.
                       I can evaluate my designs to make sure they are balanced and stable,
                       ready for physical construction or 3D printing.
