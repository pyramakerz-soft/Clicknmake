                                                A. Material Choice: The material you choose is
                                                very important because di­erent materials
                                                behave di­erently during machining. This can
                                                a­ect things like how quickly the machine can
                                                cut, how long the tools last, and how smooth
                                                the nal surface is.


                                                B. Tool Path: The route that the cutting tool
                                                follows is key to how fast and accurately the
                                                machine works. A good tool path will help get
                                                the job done more eciently.


                                                C. Part Geometry: The shape and complexity
                                                of the part you're making will determine which
                                                tools are needed and what kind of machining
                                                steps are required to create it properly.
