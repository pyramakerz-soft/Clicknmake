A Printed Circuit Board (PCB) is a at board used to                                               connect and hold electronic components. It is made of                                               a solid material, usually berglass, with thin copper                                               layers that form pathways for electricity. These                                               pathways replace wires and help connect components                                               like resistors, capacitors, and chips. PCBs are used in                                               almost all electronic devices, such as computers,                                               phones, and TVs, because they make circuits compact,                                               reliable, and easy to produce.                                                                    13","Assessment Exercise                                    Focus                           Focus                    What was one of the main challenges with early electronic circuits that               led to the invention of printed circuit boards (PCBs)?               A) They were too simple to be eective.               B) They were dicult to repair and scale up due to manual wiring.               C) They were too expensive to manufacture.               D) They required too many components to function.                 Why is a resistive mask applied to the copper plate before etching in               the PC?                A) To enhance the color of the PCB.               B) To protect certain areas of the copper from being etched away.               C) To improve the mechanical strength of the PCB.               D) To facilitate the soldering of components.                Why is the solder mask typically green, and what is its primary               function?                A) It is green to match the aesthetic of electronic devices and prevents                   oxidation.               B) It is green to signify that the PCB is ready for assembly and protects                   against dust.               C) It is green to indicate the quality of the copper traces and to insulate                   the board.                                                                                        14","How might we use basic principles                                                                   like \"ON\" and \"OFF\" to control                                                                   more complex systems?                let's                                              . .................................................................................................................                let's                                                                     . .................................................................................................................
