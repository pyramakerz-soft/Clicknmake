               By the end of the theme students will be able to:


                      Identify key components of a height sorting machine,including
                      sensors, motors, and the sorting mechanism.

                      Explain the interactions between these components and
                      theirinterdependence.

                      Recognize di erent sensor types (e.g., ultrasonic, infrared)and their
                      applications in sorting machines.

                      Analyse how coding structures a ect the performance andaccuracy
                      of the sorting machine.

                      Discuss the importance of precise measurements andcalibration for
                      sorting e ciency.


                      Investigate the properties of materials used in sortingmachines and
                      their suitability for construction.

                      Understand the relationship between an object's length andsorting
                      criteria.


                      Explore measurement accuracy principles and their relevanceto
                      sorting algorithms.


                      Analyse factors like sensor placement and motor control thatimpact
                      sorting e ectiveness.


                      Apply measurement accuracy and motor control principles
                      tooptimize the sorting machine.







               Project Task:

               Use the Engineering Design
               Process to assist Adam and Laila

               in designing and building a color
               sorting system to  x the
               malfunctioning candy sorter at
               the factory.
