Case Scenario.                       Designing a Portable Dialysis Machine                      Introduction                     Hospitals are facing a critical shortage of kidney ltration devices,                    directly impacting patient care and endangering the lives of those                    with kidney failure. Dialysis is essential for ltering waste from the                    blood when the kidneys fail, and without sucient machines, patient                    treatment is delayed. As biomedical engineers of the future, you will                    tackle this challenge by designing a portable dialysis device that could                    be used both in hospitals and at home. This project combines biology,                    3D design, mechanics, electricity, and programming to create a                    real-world solution.                       Mission                     Your mission is to design a portable, ecient, and safe dialysis                    machine that can address the shortage of kidney ltration devices.                    The goal is to build a functional prototype that can be tested, and                    potentially deployed, to improve patient access to life-saving                    treatments.                       Scenario Context                     Who: Biomedical engineers, hospitals, patients, and healthcare                    providers.                    What: Hospitals need a portable, reliable dialysis machine to mitigate                    the shortage of kidney ltration devices.                    Where: The machine will be used in both hospital settings and                    potentially for home use.                    When: The need for dialysis devices is urgent, and the project must be                    completed as soon as possible to meet this demand.                    Why: Dialysis is vital for patients with kidney failure, and the shortage                    of devices puts patients at risk.                      This project focuses on developing a practical solution to this problem.                                                                        03","Driving Question                   How can we design a portable, safe, and ecient dialysis machine                  that can help solve the shortage of kidney ltration devices in                  hospitals and homes?                   Objectives/Goals                    By the end of this project, you will:                  1.  Identify and label major organs of the urinary system (kidneys, ureters, bladder, urethra)                      on a diagram.                  2.  Articulate the primary functions of the urinary system: blood ltration, urine production,                      regulation of uid and electrolyte balance.                  3.  Use Tinkercad to create a 3D model of a kidney, applying principles of proportion, scale,                      and symmetry.                  4.  Understand the concept of uid viscosity and control ow rates in dialysis lines.                   5.  Investigate materials used in dialysis (e.g., dialysate solutions) and how they impact the                      process                  6.  Add a water pump to the ltration system and manage the power system for portable                      dialysis.                  7.  Break down complex components into simpler parts for design and digital assembly.                   8.  Use Arduino to control a water pump and simulate the speed of blood dialysis, using PWM                      to adjust ow rates.                   9.  Create an interactive website explaining the dialysis machine using HTML, CSS, and                      JavaScript.                    Your Challenge                   By the end of this project, you’ll have:                     Designed a 3D model and physical prototype of a portable dialysis machine using Tinkercad                    and Arduino, simulating the blood ltration process.                     Understood the biological importance of your design by studying the urinary system and                    ensuring your machine supports kidney function and dialysis processes.                     Implemented uid ow control by programming an Arduino to regulate ow rates,                    simulating the speed and eciency of blood ltration.                     Created an interactive website that explains the design, components, and functionality of                    your dialysis machine for healthcare professionals and users.                    Presented your prototype and website to a panel of experts or peers, demonstrating how                    your solution addresses the shortage of dialysis machines in healthcare.                                                                        04"];
