A) By counting the number of pumps used.               B) By timing how long it takes to ll a known volume of water.               C) By measuring the temperature of the water.               D) By checking the color of the water.                What is the primary function of the water pump in a dialysis system?                A) To lter impurities from the blood.               B) To circulate dialysate and blood through the dialyzer.               C) To store excess water.               D) To cool the dialysis machine.
