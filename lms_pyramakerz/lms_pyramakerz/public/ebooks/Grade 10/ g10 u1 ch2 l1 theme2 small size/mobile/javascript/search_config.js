Its job is to clean the blood by separating                                                    harmful substances from the useful parts of the blood.                                                    It ensures that only clean and safe uid passes back                                                    into the patient’s body.                                                    1.  Filtering Waste: The lter removes harmful                                                       substances like urea and toxins, which the                                                       kidneys usually remove.                                                     2.  Letting Useful Substances Stay: It allows                                                       important parts of the blood, such as proteins                                                       and blood cells, to stay in the bloodstream.                                                     3.  Safety: Made from safe materials, Allmed Filters                                                       work without causing harm to the blood or the                                                       patient.                  4.  Durability: Dialysis can last for hours, and the                 lter must work perfectly the entire time. Allmed                 Filters are reliable and don’t break down easily.                5.  Clean and Pure: These lters make sure that the                 process is sterile, meaning no germs or harmful                 particles get into the blood.                                                                      23","Assessment Exercise                                     Practice                           Practice                     What do you think viscosity means?                  . ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................                 . ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Fluid Flow in Dialysis:                                                     In the dialysis machine, blood ows through tubing                                                     while a dialysate (a uid used to remove waste) ows                                                     on the other side of a semi-permeable membrane.                                                     High blood viscosity can slow down the ow, just like                                                     the ball moves slower in honey compared to water.                                                      Temperature's Eect on Viscosity:                                                     Heating or cooling uids in the experiment                                                     demonstrates how temperature inuences viscosity.                                                     Similarly, dialysis eciency can depend on maintaining                                                     optimal blood temperature for smooth ow.                                                      Blockages and Maintenance:                                                     If blood is too viscous, it may increase the risk of                                                     blockages in dialysis tubing. Understanding viscosity                                                     helps in designing better systems and improving uid                                                     ow management.

B) Lower temperatures increase the rate of ltration.               C) Temperature has no eect on ltration.               D) Temperature aects ltration only in certain conditions.                  What is the relationship between viscosity and the rate of ltration in               dialysis?                A) Higher viscosity leads to a faster ltration rate.               B) Lower viscosity leads to a faster ltration rate.               C) Viscosity does not aect ltration rate.               D) Viscosity and ltration rate are inversely proportional.                                                                           25","Return back to the EDP paper and                                         add this to the plan part.
