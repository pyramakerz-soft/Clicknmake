                         circuit and its basic                          using Arduino
                         components.
                                                                        Create prosthetic hand

                         What is a servo motor?
                                                                        Utilize Arduino libraries to gain

                                                                        controlling their prosthetic arm.









              They designed the arm in
              Tinkercad, and soon they were
              thinking about how to make it
              move.

              Laila: "We can use a yellow DC
              motor to make it move, right?"

              Adam (shaking his head):
              "Not quite. I heard Mrs.sara
              said before If we want the arm
              to move in dierent directions
              and at dierent angles, it
              would be better to use a servo
              motor. But the question is, how
              many do we need? One might
              not be enough".

                       Dene what a servo motor is and describe its role in creating
                       controlled movements.
                       Analyse and decide whether gears or pulleys would be more eective
                       for the project goal.










                   Now that we’ve explored how gears, pulleys, and
                   servos bring movement to our robotic arm, it’s
                   time to think about how to power it.


                   Just like our muscles rely on signals from the brain
                   to move, robotic arms need electricity to function.


                   In this next section, we’ll learn how to build
                   circuits and connect motors to give our robotic
                   arm the energy it needs to come to life!
