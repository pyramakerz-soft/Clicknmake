              Omar:
              "I wish I could help carry

             Excited, Laila and Ali
             decided to start their
             journey of designing a
             robotic hand.

             Little did they know, this
             project would teach them
             about how bones and
             muscles work together -
             and even inspire ideas for
             creating tools that could
             help others in need!
