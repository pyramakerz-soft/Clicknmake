Series Circuit:                                             A series circuit is a type of electrical circuit in which all the                                             components are connected in a single path. The current                                             ows through each component one after the other.                                             If one component stops working, the entire circuit is broken.                                              Parallel Circuit:                                             A parallel circuit is a type of electrical circuit where                                             components are connected across multiple paths. The                                             current splits and ows through each path separately.                                             If one component stops working, the others continue to work                                             because the circuit is not completely broken.                                                                   27","Assessment Exercise                                    Focus                                                    Series – parallel                           Focus                    Fill in the blank with the correct word from the table.                1.
