             How to use this book?









                           In this book, students embark on an exciting journey to explore the
                           human skeletal system and the engineering behind building a bionic.
                           Through the lens of STEAM education, they’ll discover how science,
                           technology, engineering, art, and math can work together to help us
                           understand our own anatomy while learning to design functional bionic
                           hand inspired by human movement.

                           The book introduces a hands-on project where students create their
                           own bionic hand. Through engaging activities and real-world
                           applications, they’ll explore how the skeletal system supports and
                           enables movement, linking these ideas with Sustainable Development
                           Goals (SDGs) 3 (Good Health and Well-being), 4 (Quality Education), and 9
                           (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure).

                           In one section, students explore SDG 3 by examining the importance of
                           the skeletal system for human health, including bone health and injury
                           prevention. As they understand the mechanics of joints and levers,
                           they’ll draw connections between how bones and joints work together
                           to create movement and how a robotic arm mimics these movements.

                           At the SDG 4 station, students are encouraged to innovate by learning
                           foundational engineering and coding skills to operate their robotic
                           arms, linking these skills to real-world STEM careers and applications.
                           By working through challenges in constructing and programming their
                           robotic arms, students will gain insights into both human anatomy and
                           the basics of robotics.

                           Finally, focusing on SDG 9, the book connects technological
                           advancements to sustainable infrastructure. Students are inspired to
                           think about how robotic technology can assist in elds like healthcare
                           and industry, creating sustainable solutions that improve lives and
                           communities.

                           This journey through the skeletal system and robotics highlights the
                           powerful relationship between our bodies and technology, showing
                           students how knowledge in both elds can contribute to a better, more
                           innovative future. Through this engaging, story-driven approach,
                           students gain a deeper understanding of anatomy, engineering, and
                           sustainability, empowering them to imagine new ways to improve
                           health and industry.
