Implement an alarm system that triggers notications if the                         heart rate exceeds or falls below certain thresholds.                         Connect the mobile app with a heart-rate monitoring device (e.g.,                         using Bluetooth) to display real-time heart rate data on the app.                                                                                                                   30"];
