                                                   Now that you’ve learned about how blood
                                                   circulates through the body, let’s take it a
                                                   step further! Did you know that the
                                                   movement of blood can be explained using
                                                   some cool physics laws?
                                                   These laws, like Boyle’s Law and Bernoulli’s
                                                   Equation, help us understand how pressure
                                                   and ow work in the circulatory system.


                                                   Boyle’s Law:
                                                   When the pressure on a gas goes down, its
                                                   volume gets bigger. When the pressure goes
                                                   up, the volume gets smaller.


                                                   Bernoulli’s Equation:
                                                   When a uid moves faster, its pressure
                                                   becomes lower. If the uid slows down, its
                                                   pressure increases.
