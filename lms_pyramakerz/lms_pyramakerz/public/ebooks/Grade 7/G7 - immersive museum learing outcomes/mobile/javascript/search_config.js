Objectives/Goals                   1.  Research world-famous monuments and their cultural signicance.                    2.  Apply 3D modeling techniques to create digital replicas of the                      monuments, optimizing them for 3D printing.                   3.  Develop a mobile app that controls a museum car via Bluetooth,                      allowing visitors to navigate through di erent exhibits.                   4.  Build a robotic system that powers the car’s movement using                      motors and Arduino, ensuring safe navigation between exhibits.                    5.  Integrate mechanics, electronics, and sensors to ensure smooth                      operation and safety within the exhibit space.                   6.  Design a promotional website to highlight the museum’s                      technological features and cultural focus, attracting both local and                      international tourists.                          Your Challenge                   By the end of this project, you’ll have:                     Designed 3D models of famous landmarks.                    Built a robotic car that visitors can control.                    Developed an app to navigate the car around the museum.                    Created a website to promote the museum’s interactive experience.                                                                                04"];
