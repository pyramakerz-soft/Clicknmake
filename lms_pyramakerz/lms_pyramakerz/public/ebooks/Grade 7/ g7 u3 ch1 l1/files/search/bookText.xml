               Connect and control the motor using
               the Arduino, ensuring the car can
               move in dierent directions based on
               input (location) from the app (you
               made it in beginner level)

                        Identify and select the necessary components (motor, Arduino,
                        Bluetooth module, etc.) for the car.

                        Write Arduino code to control the motor's speed and direction
                        based on inputs from a mobile app.


                        Establish a Bluetooth connection between the Arduino and the
                        mobile app to transmit control commands.


                        Assemble the car, connect all components, and test the
                        functionality of the remote control system.
