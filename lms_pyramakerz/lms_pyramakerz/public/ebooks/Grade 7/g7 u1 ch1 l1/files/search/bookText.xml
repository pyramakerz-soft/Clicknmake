                Project Overview





                Adam and Laila's school organized a eld trip to an industrial
                area where they visited one of the factories.


                As they observed the workers, they noticed that the workers
                were struggling to lift and move heavy objects.



                The process was not only
                time-consuming but also
                costly due to the manual
                labor involved.


                Adam and Laila realized
                that this was a problem
                that could be solved with

                a smart solution, and
                they were determined to
                help the factory workers
                improve their eciency.

               By the end of the theme students will be able to:


                      Recognize internal and external gears.


                      Identify Pascal’s and Bernoulli’s Principles in uid systems.

                      Recall hydraulic and pneumatic basics in robotic arms.


                      Recognize robotic arms' roles in industries.

                      Minimize vibrations in robotic arms.


                      Describe robotic arm joint movement.

                      Use "IF Then ELSE" rules with Arduino.


                      Build a Python GUI for robotic arm control.

                      Assess control algorithms and servo motors.


                      Design and assemble a robotic arm.

                      Develop a user interface for the robotic arm.


                      Program and rene control algorithms.







               Project Task:


               Follow Engineering Design
               Process to help Adam and Laila
               design and build a robotic arm
               that can assist the factory
               workers in lifting and moving

               heavy objects.
