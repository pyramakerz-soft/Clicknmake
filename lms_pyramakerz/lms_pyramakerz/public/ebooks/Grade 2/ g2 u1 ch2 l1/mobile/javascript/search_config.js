A) A wheel with teeth and a at bar.               B) A type of ball.               C) A wooden stick.               D) A rope used for pulling.                 What does the pinion (gear) do in a rack and pinion system?               A) It stays still and does nothing.               B) It turns and makes the rack (at bar) move.               C) It jumps up and down.               D) It pushes the rack backwards.                 Where can we nd rack and pinion mechanisms?               A) In steering systems of cars.               B) In computer screens.               C) On the surface of the moon.               D) Inside books.
