               Mrs. Sara: "Great work so far,
               everyone! Your games are coming
               along. Now, I have an exciting idea
               for our winter section. How would
               you like to add something special to
               represent rain?"


               Laila: "Rain? But it snows in winter,
               right?"


               Mrs. Sara: "Good point, Laila! But in
               some places, winter also brings rain.
               So, we will add a water pump in the
               game to make it look like it's raining
               in the winter season. The pump will
               show water moving, just like rain
               falling from the sky!

               Adam: "A water pump? How does
               that work?"

                                  Hello friends, Let’s explore the
                                  three states of matter-solid,
                                  liquid, and gas-and see how they
                                  can magically change from one
                                  to another!


                What You’ll Need:
                 1.  Ice cubes.
                 2.  Clear plastic cups.
                 3.  Water.
                 4.  A kettle or bowl of warm water
                    (with your teacher’s help).
                 5.  Balloons.
                 6.  Vinegar and baking soda.
                 7.  Paper towels.

                What is it? A solid, liquid, or gas?


                Now, we’ll let the ice sit and
                watch it melt into water.


                Next, we’ll look at some water
                in a cup.


                What state of matter is it?





                Your teacher will heat some water.


                Watch carefully as steam
                rises-what is happening to the

                                                         around the Earth! It keeps going in a
                                                         big circle.

                                                            1.  Evaporation: When the sun heats

                                                            2.  Condensation: High up in the sky,
                                                                the water vapor cools down and

                                                                drops come together to make

                 3.  Precipitation: When the clouds
                    get heavy, the water falls back
                    to the ground as rain, snow, or
                    hail.


                 4.  Collection: The water collects in
                    lakes, rivers, and oceans. Then,
                    the cycle starts all over again!





                   The water cycle is like a never-ending journey for water!








               Let’s play this game to
               understand where rain water
               come from.

                 you for making the Carnival
                 of the Seasons such a success.

                 Each exhibit-from winter’s
                 snowakes to summer’s
                 beach fun-was lled with
                 creativity and teamwork.


                 Our visitors loved it, and you
                 should be proud of what
                 you’ve achieved. Great job
