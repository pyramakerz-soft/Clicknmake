Students will describe the key features and changes that occur in                            each season, such as weather patterns, temperatures, and                            environmental change.                             Build basic models using simple materials to represent dierent                            seasons.                              Recognize gears especially rack and pinion gears.                             Use Tinkercad to create simple 3D models of seasonal elements                            (e.g., a 3D snowake or a summer sun).                             Design basic shapes and patterns that reect dierent seasons,                            such as summer sun, snowakes, and winter homes.                             Recognize potentiometers and how to use them to control the LED                            and motor's brightness and the buzzer's sound.                             Create m. block game to represent 4 seasons.                             Understand what a water pump does, including how it moves water                            and its role in various applications.                                                                                      03"];
