                Students will be able to:
                 Students will be able to:




                           Students will recognize and name the four seasons of the year:
                           spring, summer, fall, and winter.

                           Students will describe the key features and changes that occur in
                           each season, such as weather patterns, temperatures, and
                           environmental change.

                           Build basic models using simple materials to represent dierent
                           seasons.


                           Recognize gears especially rack and pinion gears.

                           Use Tinkercad to create simple 3D models of seasonal elements
                           (e.g., a 3D snowake or a summer sun).

                           Design basic shapes and patterns that reect dierent seasons,
                           such as summer sun, snowakes, and winter homes.

                           Recognize potentiometers and how to use them to control the LED
                           and motor's brightness and the buzzer's sound.

                           Create m. block game to represent 4 seasons.

                           Understand what a water pump does, including how it moves water
                           and its role in various applications.
