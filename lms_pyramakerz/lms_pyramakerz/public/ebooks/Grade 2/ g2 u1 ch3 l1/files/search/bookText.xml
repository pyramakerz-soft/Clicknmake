               Mrs. Sara: "Okay kids,
               you've done an amazing job
               so far! I'm really proud of
               how creative you’ve been."


               Laila: "But Mrs. Sara, we
               want to control things, like
               making the motors go
               faster or slower. How can
               we do that?"

               Mrs. Sara: "That’s a great
               question, Laila! To control
               the speed of the motors,
               we can use an electric
               component. Who’s ready to
               learn how to do that?"

              What happens when you turn the knob of a potentiometer?
              A) The device turns o.
              B) The sound changes.
              C) It makes music.

              Potentiometers help control the _ in electronic devices.


              A) Light.
              B) Electricity.
              C) Water.

                          Practice





              Try connecting the circuit
              with the potentiometer
              yourself.

              First, use an LED, and then try
              it again with a buzzer and a
              motor.

                  SHOW CASE



                Change how bright the light is for summer.

                In autumn, use a motor to turn a fan that makes the leaves fall
                o a tree.
                Add a buzzer sound to your project too!"










                   NOW I CAN..



                      Understand what a potentiometer is and how it works.
                      Use a potentiometer to control dierent electric components.
