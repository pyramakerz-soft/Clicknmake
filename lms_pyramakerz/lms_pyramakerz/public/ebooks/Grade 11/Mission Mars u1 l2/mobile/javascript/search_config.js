In this task, you'll create a scaled-down sketch of your           rover on paper using accurate measurements.            Decide on the actual size of your rover (e.g., Length: 3 m, Width: 2.5 m, Height: 2 m), or           create your own realistic dimensions.           Choose a scale that fits your paper (like 1 meter = 2 cm) and clearly write it at the top of           your drawing.            Draw a top view of your rover using a ruler. Make sure to include parts like the main body,           wheels, camera, or robotic arm.           Label each part and write both the real-life size and scaled size next to them.

Your mission is to design the part of the rover that will hold and support the wheels. This           part should help the rover move smoothly across rocky and uneven Martian terrain. Think           about joints or suspension features that allow flexibility and movement.            Design Goals:              •  Create a jointed wheel support system that absorbs impact and allows mobility on                rough surfaces.              •  Use real rover dimensions or your own estimated size, then calculate the scale ratio                for your model.              •  Build your design in Tinkercad, making sure it connects properly with the rest of the                rover.                                          Showcase            Next Step: Get Ready to Print!            Once your design is complete in Tinkercad, it's time to prepare it for 3D printing. Open your           model in Cura to adjust the size, check for errors, and make it printer-ready.           When everything looks good, send your design to the 3D printer and watch your rover part           come to life!                                                                                                                                        17","Awesome work                                                      so far, team!
