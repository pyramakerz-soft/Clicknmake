              After discussing their
              model with Mr. Sara,
              Adam and Laila realized
              they needed to make
              their project even more
              interactive.

              you used some tools to
              collect real information
              from the environment?”


              Adam was excited and
              said, “That’s a great idea!
              We could use a water
              level tool to measure how
              much water is left in the
              pond and a temperature
              tool to track how hot it’s
              getting.

              small screen to display
              the readings!

                                        Just like our ve senses help us understand the world
                                        around us, there are special devices called sensors
                                        that can detect changes in their surroundings.
