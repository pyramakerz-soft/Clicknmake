                What does the BMP280 sensor measure?

                A) Sound and light.
                B) Temperature and air pressure.
                C) Movement and speed.
                D) Electricity and magnetism.

                Why is the BMP280 sensor useful in weather stations?

                A) It can detect rain and wind.
                B) It measures temperature and pressure to predict weather changes.
                C) It records the color of the sky.
                D) It controls the speed of the wind.

                How does the BMP280 sensor send the information it collects?

                A) By drawing pictures
                B) By using wires or wireless signals to send data to a computer
                C) By writing it down on paper
                D) By speaking it out loud
