              Adam and Laila were thrilled
              with their project, especially
              with the sensors showing
              real-time data. As they
              tested the water level and
              temperature sensors, their
              friend, Maya, walked over to
              check out what they were
              up to.

              Maya (curious): "Wow, this is
              really cool! But what if you
              could check the temperature
              from anywhere? You
              wouldn’t even have to stand
              next to the project."

              Adam: "That would be
              awesome, but how would we
              make that work?"

             Maya: "Why don’t you
             make a mobile app and
             connect the temperature
             sensor through

               Imagine if your toys, your refrigerator, or even your
               pet's collar could communicate with each other! IoT
               makes this possible by connecting these items to the
               internet so they can share information.

               For example, a smart thermostat can let you know if
               your house is too hot or too cold.
