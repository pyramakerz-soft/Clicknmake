              Mrs. Sara gathered the
              students and asked, "How can
              we show visitors at our
              wildlife park how the food
              chain works and what
              happens if one part is
              missing?"


              Adam said, "We could make a
              big chart to show how plants
              and animals are connected."


              Laila suggested, "Or we could
              create a fun game that shows
              the food chain in order!"

                  Let’s remember together how M.block
                  works by playing this game.

              Did you know that biologists can track sharks with tracking
              devices, and from the information they receive, they know
              a lot about their lives?



              Create a game for the food chain in the marine ecosystem.












                                          Let’s go back to EDP
                                          paper and add this  to
                                          create part.

                       creating characters (sprites) to represent dierent organisms in
                       the food chain.
                       Use loops and sequences in coding to model continuous energy
                       transfer in the food chain.
