              Okay kids, after we sorted our
              ideas and made our game, Let's
              imagine our wildlife park with
              all the animals we want to save
              on TinkerCAD rst, before we
              build the real one.

                                          and think about including the following elements in
                                          your design:


                                             Habitat: A protected space where the animal can
                                             live safely.


                                             Natural Environment: Features like trees, rocks,
                                             or bodies of water that reect the animal’s
                                             natural surroundings.


                                             Food and Water Sources: Areas designated for
                                             eating and drinking.


                                             Shelter: A safe place where the animal can rest or
                                             seek protection.


                                          These elements are essential for creating a
                                          comfortable and sustainable space for the animals
                                          in your park.
