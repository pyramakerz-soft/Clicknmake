               A)  To make the jungle game more fun.
               B)  Because they provide food for pandas and are part of the ecosystem.
               C)  To use the bamboo to build houses.
               D)  So that pandas can live alone in the forest.

                discover how food chains
                work in nature!

                                               Food chain describes the order in which
                                               organisms, or living things, depend on
                                               each other for food.

                          Focus
                          Focus




              What is the main source of energy for all living things in a food chain?
              A) Water.
              B) Soil.
              C) Sun.
              D) Air.



              Which of the following is a producer?

              A) Lion.
              B) Grass.
              C) Eagle.
              D) Shark.








                          Practice
                          Practice




              Create a poster representing the food
              chain in dierent habitats.










                                       Imagine a nature's dinner party! There are plants,
                                       animals that eat plants, and animals that eat those
                                       plant-eaters. It's like a chain, and if one part is missing,
                                       the whole chain gets wobbly.
                                       When animals lose their homes or get hunted too much,
                                       they become endangered. This breaks the nature's chain,
                                       and other animals get aected too. We need to protect
                                       them to keep the balance and a healthy planet!
