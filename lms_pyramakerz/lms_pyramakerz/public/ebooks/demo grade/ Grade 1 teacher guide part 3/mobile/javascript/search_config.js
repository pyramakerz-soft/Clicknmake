Use markers, crayons, or other supplies to add                        color and details.                 Circuit Creation Instructions:                      1.  Plan the Circuit:                            o  Mark the owl template where the LED eyes will go and where the battery and                               wires will be placed.                     2.  Place Wires:                            o  Stick wires onto the owl template, creating a path from the battery                               placement area to the LED locations.                            o  Ensure the tape is smooth, with no gaps or tears, to allow electricity to flow.                     3.  Add the LEDs:                           o  Insert the LED legs into holes for the owl’s eyes.                             o  Ensure the longer leg (positive) and shorter leg (negative) align with the wires                               path. Tape the legs down securely.                    4.  Connect the Battery:                            o  Place the coin cell battery with the positive side facing the path of the correct                               wire.                            o  Use a small piece of wire to connect the battery securely.                     5.  Create a Switch:                            o  Leave a small gap in the wires. Use a piece of paper or cardstock to bridge the                               gap and complete the circuit when pressed.                     6.

Question:                How do you think the remote control can change the channels on the TV without touching it?                 Possible Answers:                     1.  Radio Waves – The remote control sends signals to the TV using infrared or radio waves. The                        TV receives the signal from the remote and changes the channel based on the command.                     2.  Infrared Technology – The remote control uses infrared light, which is invisible to the human                        eye, to send signals to the TV. When you press a button, the remote emits an infrared beam,                        and the TV's sensor picks it up to perform the desired action.                     3.  Wireless Communication – The remote control communicates wirelessly with the TV,                        allowing it to change channels, adjust volume, and perform other functions from a distance                        without direct contact.

Strategy: \"Brainstorming\"                    How to Implement:                         o  The teacher writes the central concept (Remote Control) on the board or digital platform                           and asks students to brainstorm ideas and connections related to how a remote control                           works without physical contact.                         o  Students can share their ideas aloud or write them down on sticky notes or a digital                           document. Encourage them to think of technologies, devices, or concepts that could                           explain how remote controls function (e.g., infrared light, radio waves, wireless                           communication).                        o  After brainstorming, discuss the connections and group similar ideas together.                 2.  Strategy: \"Think-Pair-Share\"                    How to Implement:                         o  The teacher poses the think question to the class and gives students a few moments to                           think about it individually.                        o  Next, students pair up to discuss their thoughts and ideas about how remote controls                           work.                         o  Finally, the teacher asks pairs to share their ideas with the entire class. This encourages                           participation and allows students to learn from each other's responses.                 3.  Strategy: \"Concept Mapping\"                    How to Implement:                        o  After brainstorming, the teacher can guide students in creating a concept map to visually                           represent how a remote control works.                         o  This can be done on the board or using digital tools where students link ideas like                           \"Infrared Light,\" \"Wireless Signals,\" and \"TV Sensor\" to the main concept of the remote                           control. This helps organize their thoughts and visually display the connections.                 4.
