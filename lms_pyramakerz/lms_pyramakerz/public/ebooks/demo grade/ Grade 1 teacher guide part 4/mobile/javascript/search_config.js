Strategies for implementation                 You can apply the same strategies applied before in the story part.                                                                     112                                                             112","Questions and Possible Answers                 Question: What colors could we use on our lights to show hot and cold                places where animals live?                 Possible Answers:                     1.  Desert: We could use yellow, orange, or red to represent the                        hot temperatures in the desert. These colors are often                        associated with warmth and heat.                     2.  Underwater: For underwater, we could use blue and green to                        reflect the cool and calming atmosphere of the ocean. These                        colors are commonly associated with water and cold                        environments.                     3.  Snowy Place: In a snowy place, we could use white, light blue,                        or icy blue to represent the cold and frosty environment, as                        these colors symbolize snow, ice, and cold temperatures.           Strategies for implementation                       1.  Brainstorming Session                            o  How to Implement: Ask students to think about the colors they associate with hot,                               cold, and neutral places. Then, let them share their thoughts aloud while the teacher                               records ideas on a whiteboard. This creates a collaborative environment and helps                               students express their ideas.                     2.  Visual Stimuli                            o  How to Implement: Show the three photos (desert, underwater, snowy place) and                               ask students to suggest which colors could represent the environments in the                               pictures. This strategy uses visuals to stimulate thinking and help students connect                               the colors to real-life environments.                     3.   color Associations                            o  How to Implement: Ask students to close their eyes and imagine being in each of                               the three environments (desert, underwater, snowy place). Then, have them choose                               colors that would help them feel like they belong in each place. This method taps                               into sensory and emotional connections with colors.                     4.  Think-Pair-Share                            o  How to Implement: Have students individually come up with their color choices,                               then pair up with a classmate to compare answers. Afterward, students can share                               their pair’s ideas with the class. This promotes collaboration and helps students                               think critically about the colors they chose.                     5.  Interactive Voting                                                              113                                                             113","o  How to Implement: After brainstorming the colors for each environment, use an                               online tool or physical voting system to allow students to vote on the  colors they                               think would best represent each place. This makes the activity more engaging and                               gives students a sense of involvement in the decision-making process.                 2..Explore:                 Teacher Role                       Guide students in understanding the relationship between colors and environments (e.g.,                        hot vs. cold places).                       Facilitate hands-on engagement with the LED matrix by providing instructions, answering                        questions, and encouraging creativity.                       Ensure students understand the connection between colors and their symbolic meanings.                 Expected From Students                       Participate actively by identifying the appropriate colors for different animal habitats.                       Operate the LED matrix to light up the chosen colors and create patterns.                       Reflect on how the colors represent various environments and how patterns can                        communicate information.

During Watching: Active Engagement                       Encourage students to pause the video at certain points to discuss what they’ve learned                        (e.g., how combining red and blue creates magenta).                       Ask students to observe the examples of color mixing shown in the video and write down                        any interesting insights.                 Post-Watching: Discussion and Reflection                       Discussion Questions:                            1.  How do the three primary colors of light combine to create different colors?                           2.  What happens when all three colors (red, green, and blue) are mixed?                            3.  How does the brightness of an LED affect the color that is seen?                       Reflection Activity:                            o  Have students explain the concept of RGB color mixing in their own words.                            o  Ask them to predict what happens if one of the LEDs in the RGB setup fails and how                               that would affect the color produced.                Strategies for Delivery                      1.  Think-Pair-Share: After watching, pair students to discuss what they learned, then share                        with the class.                     2.  Graphic Organizer: Use a Venn diagram to compare and contrast colors created by mixing                        red, green, and blue.                     3.  Demonstration with Hands-On Application: Use RGB LEDs and a controller in class to                        reinforce concepts shown in the video.                     4.  Interactive Q\&A: Encourage students to ask and answer each other’s questions about the                        video content.                                                                     116                                                             116","4.Elaborate:                Teacher Role                        Encourage students to think creatively about how they can use the LED matrix in practical                        scenarios.                       Guide students in creating circuits while ensuring safety precautions are followed.                       Support students in answering questions and refining their understanding of how the LED                        matrix works.                       Provide feedback and motivate students to explore further applications at home.

Provide constructive                        criticism to improve their designs.                 Expected From Students:                       Answer questions about LED matrices, animal housing, and the integration process.                       Demonstrate an understanding of the concepts taught during the session.                       Successfully implement the LED matrix in their animal’s house project.                                                 Evaluate the students' work on the main project: adding the LED matrix to their animal’s house.
