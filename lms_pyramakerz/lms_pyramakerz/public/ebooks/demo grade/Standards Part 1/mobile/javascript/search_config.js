Connect to a                    Mobile App:                      Develop a                       mobile                     application                    that connects                    to the glasses                    and converts                       text to                      speech.                     Enable users                      to \"read\"                    signs, labels,                      or other                       written                     information.                       Code the                      System:                     Write Arduino                      code to                      process                     sensor data                     and control                     the buzzer.                         Use                     conditional                     statements                    (e.g., if-else)                      to make                      decisions                      based on                      obstacle                      detection.                       Test and                      Improve:                       Test the                     glasses in                     real-world                    scenarios to                     ensure they                       detect","obstacles                     accurately                     and provide                        clear                      feedback.                     Iterate on the                     design and                       code to                      improve                     functionality                      and user                     experience."];
