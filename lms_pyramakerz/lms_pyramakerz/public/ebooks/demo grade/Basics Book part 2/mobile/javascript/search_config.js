To start with, we select a box. Simply drag and drop the box from                    the menu to the workplane.                                                    You can change on the features of the basic geometric shapes and                    merge or group different shapes to make a whole model then use                    printers to print it.                       Let’s take a look on 3D printing process                     1.  Prepare your 3D model. Make sure that your 3D model is in a                       format that is compatible with your 3D printer.                      2.  Slice your 3D model. Once your 3D model is in the correct                       format, you need to slice it into layers.                      3.  Load your ﬁlament.  You need to load your ﬁlament into your 3D                       printer. The type of ﬁlament you use will depend on the                       properties of your 3D model.                        Note: Filaments used in 3D printing are thermoplastics, which are                    plastics that melt rather than burn when heated, can be shaped                    and molded, and solidify when cooled.                     Level 01 - Design  [Tinker CAD]  - Lesson 01","4.  Start printing. Once your ﬁlament is loaded, you can start                       printing your model.                      5.  Remove your model. Once the printing process is complete, you                       can remove your model from the 3D printer. It is important to                       let your model cool down completely before you try to remove                       it.                       6.  Finish your model. Once your model is cool, you can ﬁnish it by                       sanding it, painting it, or adding other decorations.                                                          Let’s know more about AR                    AR, or augmented reality, is a technology that superimposes a                    computer-generated image on a user's view of the real world.                    Tinkercad has an AR viewer that allows you to view your Tinkercad                    designs in the real world.

Imagine if all the things around us have the same                    dimensions, tree is the same size of car and pencil is the                    same size of your desk!                      Scale and proportion are both                    design elements that have to do                    with size.                     Scale is the size of one object in                    relation to the other objects in a                    design.                     Proportion refers to the size of the                    parts of an object in relationship to                    other parts of the same object.                        Let’s understand how to change dimensions of any shape on                    TinkerCAD                    •   Changing dimensions allows you to quickly modify 3D shapes. Start by                        dragging a cylinder onto the work plane and zoom in.                    •   Now with the shape selected, mouse over the white grips, or the black                        midpoint grips to see the dimensional values.                     Deﬁnition:  Grips are small squares on corners or middle of any shape.                     •   Any shape has 3 main dimensions which are length, width and height.                    •   You can change any of these by ﬁrst clicking on the grip and then                        clicking on the value to adjust it, press Enter when done.                    •   Change length and width to be 30 mm and height to be 50 mm.                      Note: it’s important to know the working measuring unit as a unit of measurement is a                    system you use to describe how big or small something this.                      •   You can also click and drag the grips to                        work more organically.                    •   Clicking and dragging the black grips at                        the mid points changes the dimensions in                        one direction. Clicking on the white corner                        grips changes two dimensions at once, and                        then clicking and dragging on the top                        white grip allows you to adjust the height.                          https://youtu.be/AV                       C-426M6V0                                         Scan Here!

Snap Grid                      By default, Tinkercad moves the objects on the workplane                    by 1mm increments. The snap grid feature in Tinkercad                    allows you to make smaller or larger movements.                    Snap grid is hidden in the bottom right corner of the design                    area. Click the black drop down arrow to see the snap grid                    options.

To create a key chain design with holes or                    engraving, you have to understand some shape                    Manipulation, attributes and basic functions.                        Shape Manipulation                     The three main shape manipulations are:                     1.  Selecting.                    2. Moving.                    3. Resizing a shape.                         Selecting                    Select any basic shape and drag it then drop on your workplane to make                    your own design.                         Moving                     •   Move your shape by left click and drag the mouse to move it to the                        location you want.                    •   You can move the shape above the workplane or below the workplane                        from the curved arrow on the middle of the shape.                    Note: This movement up and down, perpendicular to the work plane, is called moving on                    the Z-axis.                    •   You can also use the arrow keys to move on the Z-axis. Make sure your                        shape is selected, and hold down the Control key, and use the up and                        down arrows.                         Resizing a shape                     •   Changing dimensions allows you to quickly                        modify 3D shapes. Start by dragging your shape                        onto the work plane and zoom in.                    •   With the shape selected, mouse over the white                        grips, or the black midpoint grips to see the                        dimensional values.                     Deﬁnition:  Grips are small squares on corners or middle                    of any shape.                    •   You can change any of these by ﬁrst clicking on                        the grip and then clicking on the value to adjust                        it, press Enter when done.

Shape attributes                     The three main shape manipulations are:                    1.  Hide and Lock.                    2. Solid and hole.                        1. Hide and Lock shapes                          Hiding Objects:                        TinkerCAD recently added the ability to hide objects from the                        workplane. This removes an object from the visibility on the workplane                        without deleting it. When an object is hidden you’re unable to interact                        with it.                         Let’s look at an example                        You have two objects that are rather close to each other on the                        workplane and you need to move one without impacting the other. In                        this example, let’s suppose you want to do some involved editing on                        the cylinder but since it’s so close to the other rectangles you ﬁnd                        that the interface is cluttered and you make unintended changes to                        the other shapes.                          To hide an object:                           1.  First select the object on the workplane.                          2. Once you’ve selected the object, click the lightbulb icon in the                              Shape panel. This icon won’t be available unless you have a shape                              selected.                          3. Once you hide the shape you’ll see that the lightbulb icon is now                              active on the main toolbar. This indicates that there are hidden                              shapes on the workplane.                          4. Click this lightbulb to show all of the hidden shapes.                                 Level 01 - Design  [Tinker CAD]  - Lesson 04","Locking Objects:                         Locking an object makes it unable to move or be edited. Locking has                        a similar use case as hiding with the main difference being that a                        locked object remains visible.                          Let’s look at an example                        There are three cylinders that are set within a red rectangle. Let’s                        suppose that this positioning is precise and is exactly where it                        should be. Let’s lock the grouped cylinders to prevent any                        unintentional shifts.                          To lock an object:                         First select it on the workplane. This can be a single object or a                        group of objects. In this example, let’s select the grouped cylinders.                          Once the object is selected, click the lock icon in the Shape panel.                        Once locked you’ll be unable to move or edit the object.                          If you need to edit a locked object you need to unlock it ﬁrst. To                        unlock an object, select it and then click the lock icon.                                              2.  Solid, Hole , and Combined Structures                      Tinkercad operates on the principle of Boolean design, which allows                     the subtraction of objects to create empty areas and the addition of                     objects to form new shapes.                       •   A Solid in TinkerCAD is a shape that is visible and editable.                     •   A hole in TinkerCAD is a shape that when grouped with another                         object, will remove material instead of joining together.                     •   After creating some basic shapes in TinkerCAD, they can be                         combined to create more complicated structures.                       Level 01 - Design  [Tinker CAD]  - Lesson 04","Basic functions                      1.  Copy and Paste.                     2. Duplicate and Repeat.                     3. Delete, Undo, and Redo.                        1. Copy and Paste                      Basic copy and paste commands are an intuitive way to clone                     elements of your design.                       2.   Duplicate and Repeat                      Duplicate is one of the most                     powerful, least understood                     features of Tinkercad.                     Don’t think of it as a way of                     duplicating objects (copy and                     paste can take care of that).                     Instead, the Duplicate and                     Repeat feature can recall and                     repeat a series of actions.                        For example, by duplicating and repeating size, workplane, and                     height adjustments, you can create a pyramid in seconds.                        1.  Drag a box and change base size to 45 mm                        (use scaling feature to make length and width                        equal) then height size to 4mm and change                        the color to yellow.                             2.  Duplicate the box and Drag it up from the                        block arrow and change base size to 40 mm                        and center it.                             3.  Duplicate many times till you ﬁnish the                        pyramid design.                       Level 01 - Design  [Tinker CAD]  - Lesson 04","3.

Do you notice the                   symmetry in that                    design?                         To understand the symmetry, it is simply one shape that is ﬂipped                   exactly like another. In architecture, the symmetry refers to the                   geometry of a building, as the building is same on either side of the                   axis.                     It is commonly used in architecture by creating two sides as mirror                   images of each other, and can be vertical (up and down axis) or                   horizontal (across the axis).                     As for example: Taj Mahal at Agra is planned by following the axis                   with symmetrical design in plan and overall campus as the mirror                   image as shown in ﬁgure.                                                       Level 01 - Design  [Tinker CAD]  - Lesson 05","Here are many types of symmetry, but two main types are often                   distinguished                       1. Rotational symmetry                    Rotational symmetry is a type of symmetry in which an object looks                   the same after it has been rotated by a certain angle around a                   central point or axis. The central point or axis is called the \"center of                   rotation.                       You have to learn how to use the rotation tool in TinkerCAD.                      TinkerCAD's rotate tool allows you to change the angle of your                   model or part of your model along the x, y or z axis.                    If you’ve rotated an object in TinkerCAD, you may have noticed that                   two distinct rings appear around your object -- an outer ring with                   many ﬁne markings, and an inner ring with just a few larger                   markings.                    By keeping your cursor over one of the two rings while you rotate                   your object, you can modify the precision of the rotation. Use the                   inner ring to rotate in increments of 22.5 degrees, or use the outer                   ring for rotating one degree at a time.

Linear symmetry                    Linear symmetry is type of symmetry in which a line is drawn from                   the middle of the shape.                   The two parts of the shape coincide, and then each part is called the                   mirror image of the other.                     You have to learn how to use the Mirror tool in TinkerCAD.                     By using the Mirror feature from the top bar, you can ﬂip your                   design around in multiple directions. This is often used for creating                   stamp designs, reversing text on objects intended to be 3D printed                   face-down on a print bed, or a quick way to design objects.                   To mirror an object in TinkerCAD, you can use the \"Mirror\"                   command.                    Here's how:                    1. Open TinkerCAD and select the object you want to mirror.                   2. Click on the \"Duplicate\" button to create a copy of the object.                   3. Select the copy of the object, and then click on the \"Mirror\"                       button located in the toolbar at the top of the screen.                       Alternatively, you can right-click on the object and select \"Mirror\"                       from the context menu.                   4. A dialog box will appear with options for the mirroring operation.                       You can choose to mirror the object along the X, Y, or Z axis, and                       you can also choose to mirror it with respect to the object's                       center or a speciﬁc point.                   5. After making your selections, click on the \"Mirror\" button in the                       dialog box to perform the mirroring operation.                   6. The mirrored object will now appear alongside the original                       object. You can move and manipulate the mirrored object as you                       would with any other object in TinkerCAD.                     Note that the \"Mirror\" command is only available for certain types of objects in TinkerCAD,                   such as boxes and cylinders. If you are unable to use the \"Mirror\" command for a particular                   object, you may need to use other techniques, such as duplicating and ﬂipping the object                   manually.                                 Note: A line that divides an object or shape into two parts that are mirror images of each                   other is called line of symmetry.                 Level 01 - Design  [Tinker CAD]  - Lesson 05","Split objects                    Splitting objects is an important function in Tinkercad because it                   allows you to create complex shapes and designs by combining                   multiple simpler shapes. By splitting an object into smaller parts,                   you can manipulate each part individually, adjust their positions and                   orientations, and then recombine them to create a more complex                   object.                       To split objects in TinkerCAD, follow these steps:                    1.  Open TinkerCAD and select the object that you want to split.                   2.  Use the \"Box\" tool to draw a box around the area where you want                       to split the object. Make sure that the box completely surrounds                       the area you want to cut.                   3.  With the box selected, go to the \"Shape Generators\" menu and                       select \"Hole\". This will turn the box into a hole.                                         4. Position the hole over the area where                       you want to make the split and adjust                       its size and position as necessary.                   5. With the hole still selected, click on the                       \"Group\" button to group the hole and                       the original object.                   6. Finally, click on the \"Subtract\" button to                       subtract the hole from the original                       object, creating the split.                   7. You can now move and manipulate the                       two parts of the object separately.                           Level 01 - Design  [Tinker CAD]  - Lesson 05","8.

The main dierence between AC and DC lies in the                    direction in which the electrons ow.                      In DC, the electrons ow steadily in a single direction,                     while electrons keep switching directions, going forward                    and then backwards in AC.                                                            What is an Alternating Current (AC)?                     The alternating current is one type of Electric current that                    changes its magnitude and polarity at regular intervals of time                    (periodically).                      When the load Resistor (R) is connected to an alternating current                    source, then the current start ﬂowing through it. At ﬁrst the                    current ﬂows in one direction, then it ﬂows in the opposite                    direction, it happens periodically. It means the polarity of the                    current source always changes at regular intervals of time. The                    ﬁgure is shown below.

In other words, we can say that Alternating current is the ﬂow of                    Electric charge (Electrons) through a conductor which changes                    direction periodically. Since the current ﬂow changes the direction                    periodically, therefore the voltage polarity also changes with it. It                    means the high potential (+) and low potential (-) swaps together.                    When an alternating current passes through a conductor(wire),                    the electrons of the conductor ﬁrst ﬂow in one direction, then it                    ﬂows in the opposite direction, this happens periodically.                    For example, the mains line voltage supply of Egypt is about 220                    volts, it has a frequency of 50Hz, which means the current                    changes direction 50 times a second.                                                Level 02 - Electricity - Lesson 01","Alternating Current Waveform                     The amplitude of the alternating current/voltage varies                    continuously according to the time period, which can be                    represented by a waveform.                    The wave shape or waveform is a graph that represents the                    amplitude change of an alternating current/voltage with respect                    to the time period, where the amplitude of alternating current and                    voltage is taken along the y-axis of the graph and the time period                    taken along the x-axis. The amplitude of the alternating                    current/voltage oscillates between its maximum peak point and                    its minimum peak point along with a common reference point.

A Breadboard is simply a board for building circuits on.                     It allows you to place components and connections on the                    board to make circuits without soldering. The holes in the                    breadboard take care of your connections by physically                    holding onto parts or wires where you put them and                    electrically connecting them inside the board. The ease of                    use and speed are great for learning and quick building of                    simple circuits. More complex circuits and high frequency                    circuits are less suited to breadboarding. Modern                    breadboards are made from plastic, and come in all                    shapes, sizes, and even dierent colors. While larger and                    smaller sizes are available, the most common sizes you will                    probably see are \"full-size,\" \"half-size,\" and \"mini\"                     breadboards.                                                                  Level 02 - Electricity - Lesson 02","Before the advent of breadboards,                    electronic circuits were typically                    constructed using different methods                    and materials.                            How do electronic components t into a breadboard?                     Many electronic components have long metal legs called leads.                    Sometimes, shorter metal legs are referred to as pins instead.                    Almost all components with leads will work with a breadboard.                    Breadboard is designed so you can push these leads into the holes,                    and they will not fall out.                                                     What is inside a breadboard?                     The holes in a breadboard are connected                    by metal strips that run underneath the                    board. These metal strips are arranged in                    a speciﬁc way, so that each row of holes                    is electrically connected to the next row.                    These metal strips are arranged inside a                    beadboard as show:                        Level 02 - Electricity - Lesson 02","Breadboard Rows and Columns                     The columns of holes are also                    connected to each other through                    the metal strips, but they are not                    connected to the rows.                    There are two types of holes in a                    breadboard: power rails and                    terminals. Power rails are the two                    columns of holes on the outside of                    the breadboard. They are                    connected to a power supply, so                    you can use them to power your                    circuit.                        These strips are typically marked by                    red and blue  lines, with plus (+) and                    minus (-) signs. They are called                    buses, and typically used to supply                    electrical power to your circuit                    when you connect them to a                    battery pack or other external                    power supply. Use this table to                    differentiate between positive and                    negative.                         Level 02 - Electricity - Lesson 02","How are the holes connected?                      Remember that the inside of the                    breadboard is made up of sets of                    ﬁve metal clips. This means that                    each set of ﬁve holes forming a                    half-row  is electrically connected.                    For example, that means hole A1 is                    electrically connected to holes B1,                    C1, D1, and E1, and all of these can                    be called a node. It is not                    connected to hole A2, because that                    hole is in a different row, with a                    separate set of metal clips. It is also                    not connected to holes F1, G1, H1, I1,                    or J1, because they are on the other                    \"half\" of the breadboard—the clips                    are not connected across the gap in                    the middle.                          How can we put a component into the bread board?                     The pins of your component must be on different rows, or on                    different sides of the board. Below you can see two ways to connect                    a resistor.

It                    consists of various components connected together to perform                    speciﬁc functions.                    There are two types of circuits we can make, called series and                    parallel circuits , and the components in a circuit are joined by                    wires.                        Series circuits                     In a television series, you get several episodes, one after the other.                    A series circuit is similar. You get several components one after the                    other.                    If you follow the circuit diagram from one side of the cell to the                    other, you should pass through all the different components, one                    after the other, without any branches.                    Series circuits have single Paths; there is only one path for the                    electric current to follow. It starts from the positive (+) terminal of                    the power source, ﬂows through each component in the circuit,                    and returns to the negative (-) terminal of the power source.
