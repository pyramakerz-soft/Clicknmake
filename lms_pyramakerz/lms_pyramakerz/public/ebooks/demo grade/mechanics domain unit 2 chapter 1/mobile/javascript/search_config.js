Car 2 :                            •  Wheels: rubber tires – better grip and smoother rolling.                           •  Design: Smooth to the ground  – reduced air resistance and improved high-speed                               stability.                           •  Movement: Likely fastest and most stable; efficient movement and good handling.","Car 3 :                            •  Wheels: largest wheels, rubber tires. They look wider than the 1st car wheels, which                               might offer more stability.                           •  Design: Boxy shape, possibly heavier than the other two. The flat front will create more                               air resistance.                     Predicted Movement: Likely a middle ground between the other two. The wider wheels should                        provide decent stability, but the boxy design will create more drag, slowing it down. It might be                        more robust than the 1st car though.                   4. Explain                       Teacher Role:                     1.

Design the Base (using CAD software):                    o  Design the car base in CAD software.                    o  Include:                             Precise axle holes (as before).                             Mounting points for the DC motors. These could be slots, holes for screws, or a                               designated area for gluing.                             Consider space for the battery pack and switch.             2.  Design Motor Mounts (if needed):                    o  If you're not directly mounting the motors to the base, design motor mounts in CAD software.                        These should securely hold the motors and allow for easy attachment to the base.             3.  Laser Cutting/3D Printing:                    o  Laser cut the wooden base and any laser-cut motor mounts.                    o  If you designed 3D printed mounts, print them now.             4.  Connect Wheels to Motors:                    o  This is where the power gets transferred! There are a few ways to do this:                             Direct Drive: Attach the wheels directly to the motor shafts (if the shafts are the right                               size).                             Gears: Use gears to change the speed and torque of the motors.                             Couplers: Use flexible or rigid couplers to connect the motor shafts to the axles.","5.  Wiring:                    o  Connect the motors to the power source (battery pack) using wires.                    o  Include a switch in the circuit to control the power flow.                    o  Make sure the wiring is neat and secure to prevent shorts or disconnections.
