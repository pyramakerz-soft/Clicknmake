(Encourage students to think about animals they didn’t initially associate                                          with a particular habitat.)                                        What would happen if an animal was placed in the wrong habitat?                                          (Example: Could a penguin survive in the desert? Why or why not?)                             o  Encourage them to brainstorm ways to protect animal habitats.                3- Explain                  Teacher Role                        Introduce the purpose of watching the video and connect it to the activity.                      Guide students to actively engage with the video by asking reflective questions before and                        during viewing.                       Facilitate discussions and reflections after watching to ensure understanding of key                        concepts.                       Support vocabulary development by explaining key terms before the video.

Start with a question like, “Where do you think a fish lives?” to activate                        prior knowledge.                       Preview the Video: Tell students they will watch a video showing different animals                        and their homes. Encourage them to look closely at each animal and try to                        remember where it lives.                  3. Watching the Video (Active Engagement Techniques)                       Watch \& Pause: Play the video, pausing after each animal to ask, “Where does this                        animal live?” Encourage students to shout out the answer or make a hand signal for                        different habitats (e.g., wave for ocean, roar for jungle).                       Whisper Partners: After each animal, let students quickly discuss with a partner                        where they think the animal’s home is, reinforcing their ideas before moving on.                  4. Matching Activity                       Animal Sorting Game: After watching, give each student or small group a set of                        animal and habitat cards.                            o  Instructions: Ask students to match each animal with the habitat they believe                               is its home and then place it on the corresponding section of the board.                       Discussion: Once all students have matched the animals, go through each habitat                        together. Ask questions like, “Why do you think a polar bear lives in the arctic?” to                        encourage critical thinking.            Strategies to use with this part                     1.  Inquiry-Based Learning:                             o  Use open-ended questions to guide students’ thinking, such as, “Why do                               animals need special homes?” This encourages students to think about the                               role habitats play in survival.                   2.  Hands-On Learning:                            o  Allowing students to physically match animals with habitats makes the                               activity more engaging and helps with memory retention.                    3.  Collaboration:                            o  Partner or group work during matching and discussions fosters                               communication and encourages students to learn from each other’s ideas.                    4.  Visual Learning:                                                                 17                                                             17","o  Using images and creating a colorful habitat board caters to visual learners                               and helps reinforce concepts through association.

Introduction:                             o  Explain the purpose of the activity: Students will observe different screws and                               describe their characteristics using specific words.                            o  Go over each descriptive word with the class and provide a few examples,                               such as, “This screw is shiny and pointed” or “This one is short and round.”                            o  Highlight why it’s important to pay attention to small details when describing                                objects in science.                     3.  \"Do It\" Activity:                            o  Observation Instructions:                                      Give each student or group a set of screws to observe.                                     Ask students to look closely at each screw and use the descriptive                                      words to identify their shapes, sizes, textures, and finishes.                                                             29                                                             29","  Students will record their observations in the worksheet table, writing                                      down which words apply to each screw.                                     Allow students 1-2 minutes per screw to complete their descriptions,                                      using a timer to keep them focused if needed.                                      Let them fill their observations in this table                       Screw Number        Size          Shape        Thread Pattern        Head Shape                           4.  Discovery Phase:                            o  Once all screws have been described, review the observations as a class.                                      Discuss which words were commonly used and any differences                                      between screws.                                     Encourage students to share why they chose certain words for specific                                      screws (e.g., “I think this one is shiny because it reflects the light” or                                      “This one is pointed because it has a sharp end”).                                      Clarify any misunderstandings about the descriptive words, and                                      explain why specific characteristics might be useful for screws in                                      different applications.                     5.  Reflection:                            o  Ask students to write down or share one new thing they learned about                                observing and describing objects.                            o  Encourage them to think of other everyday objects they could describe using                               similar words, reinforcing observation skills.           Strategies and Implementation                        Inquiry-Based Learning:                            o  Encourage students to make observations and ask questions as they examine                               each screw, fostering critical thinking about the screws' physical                               characteristics.                                                                30                                                             30"];
