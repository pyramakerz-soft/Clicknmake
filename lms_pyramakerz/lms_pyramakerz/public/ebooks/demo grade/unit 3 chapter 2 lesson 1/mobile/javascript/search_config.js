Engage:                            Teacher Role:                     ●  Guide the students through the process of brainstorming and sketching a simple website                        idea. Encourage creativity and focus on user experience and functionality.                    ●  Introduce the concept of wireframing and its importance in web design. Explain how                        wireframes help visualize the layout and structure of a website before writing any code.                     ●  Demonstrate basic wireframing techniques using pen and paper or digital tools.                     ●  Provide a brief overview of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Explain their roles in creating a                        website (HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity).                    ●  Ask probing questions to check for understanding and encourage deeper thinking about the                        purpose of each website element and how it will be implemented using code. For example:                        \"How will we use HTML to create the basic structure of the website?\", \"Which CSS properties                        will we use to style the elements?\", \"How can we use JavaScript to make this website                        interactive?\"                            Expected From Students:                     ●  Students should actively participate in brainstorming sessions and share their website ideas                        with the class.                     ●  Students should attempt to create basic wireframes for their website ideas.                    ●  Students should ask questions to clarify concepts and demonstrate their understanding of                        the wireframing process and the role of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For example: \"How do                        we use CSS to make the background image responsive?\", \"What JavaScript event listeners                        can we use to trigger actions on the website?\"                     ●  Students should work together to critique and refine their wireframe designs and discuss                        how to implement their ideas using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript                 Parts of the Books Included:","Strategies to Engage Students:                 Make Predication                          How to Implement:                ●  Begin the session by asking the students: “Imagine you’re creating a website for a popular tourist                    destination. How do you think you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make it visually  appealing,  easy                    to navigate, and provide a great user experience?”                ●  Start with a discussion:  “Have you ever visited a website that you found particularly  engaging or frustrating?                    What made it that way?                   Questions for Reflection:          ●                        What are some key elements  of a successful  tourism  website?                        ■  How can we use HTML  to structure  the website  for clear navigation  and presentation  of                           information?                        ■  What CSS techniques  can we use to make the website visually  appealing  and engaging?                        ■  How can JavaScript  enhance  the user experience,  for example,  by providing  interactive                           maps, booking  forms,  or multimedia  elements?                          Suggested Answers:          ●                A successful tourism website should be visually appealing, easy to navigate, informative, and user-friendly.                ○  HTML can be used to structure the website with clear sections for destinations, attractions,                    accommodation, and travel information.                ○  CSS can be used to style the website with attractive colors, fonts, and images, and to create a responsive                    layout that adapts to different screen sizes.                ○  JavaScript can be used to create interactive maps, display travel information dynamically, handle form                    submissions, and provide multimedia content like videos or virtual tours       .                           Strategies to Deliver the Reflection Part:                     1.  Think-Pair-Share                            o  Have students think about the reflection questions individually for a few                               moments, then pair up with a partner to discuss their answers. Afterward, have                               pairs share their thoughts with the class.                    2.  Group Discussion                            o  Facilitate a whole-class discussion to explore different ideas and perspectives                               on the questions. Encourage students to build upon each other's ideas and                               consider alternative approaches.","","2.Explore:                            Teacher Role.                ●  Encourage students to think about user flow: Ask them to consider how users will navigate between                    different pages and how they can make the website easy to use.                ●  Prompt students to experiment with different layouts and design elements: Encourage them to try                    different arrangements of elements on the page and explore how different colors and fonts can affect the                    overall look and feel of the website                ●   Guide students in creating a basic wireframe for their website: Encourage them to use Excalidraw to                    sketch out the main sections of their website, such as the homepage, about us, destinations, and contact.                              Expected From Students                     ●  Create a basic wireframe for their tourism website using Excalidraw.                     ●  Experiment with different layout options and design elements.                     ●  Consider the user experience and how users will navigate the website.                     ●  Ask questions to clarify any doubts about using Excalidraw or the wireframing                        process.                     ●  Share their wireframes with classmates and provide constructive feedback","Parts of the Books Included                                           Activity - Do It                                                              Step-by-Step Instructions:                        Step 1: Open Excalidraw                         1.

Draw a rectangle for the main frame:                            - Use the rectangle tool to create a large box that will act as the main website                        container.                            - Adjust the size to represent the visible area of a webpage.                           2. Add a header:                            - At the top of the frame, create a horizontal rectangular box.                           - Divide it into sections for the logo and navigation links:                              - Add a box for the logo (left-aligned).                              - Create smaller boxes for navigation links such as \"About us,\" \"Tours,\" \"Services,\"                        and \"Contact us\" (right-aligned).                           Step 3: Add the Website Tagline and Call-to-Action                        1. Tagline:                            - In the center of the page, add a large rectangular text box.                            - Write the tagline: \"Explore the world with us.\"                            - Use the text tool and adjust the font size for prominence.                          2. Call-to-Action Button:                            - Below the tagline, draw a smaller rectangle.                            - Fill it with black or a dark color to represent a button.                            - Add text like \"Plan your trip\" inside the button using white text                         Step 4: Add Navigation Links on the Left Sidebar                        1. Use the rectangle tool to create vertical buttons along the left side of the frame.                         2. Label the buttons as follows:                            - \"About us\"                            - \"Our Tours\"                            - \"Our Services\"                           - \"Contact us\"                         3.
