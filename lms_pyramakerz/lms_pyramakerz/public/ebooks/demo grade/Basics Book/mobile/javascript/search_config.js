We need a power source that will motivate the ﬂow of the current                    in the circuit.                        We can provide a power source in the electric circuit from a battery.                       Battery                         A battery converts chemical energy into                        electrical energy. It is used in a circuit to                        power other components.                        Batteries are connected to several                        components to build an electric circuit.                       LED                        It is a component that makes light when                        electricity ﬂows through it.                       Wires                        Jumper wires have connector pins at                        each end, wires are conductors as they                        are made of copper which is good                        conductor of electricity.                      Resistance                         A resistor limits the electrical current                        that ﬂows through a circuit. Resistors                        are useful as they protect components                        from burning out.                          Electrical components change the electrical energy to another form                    of energy as resistance changes electric energy into thermal energy.

Connect the LED's negative end                       (the shorter side) to a resistor's                       terminal.                      3.  Connect the other terminal of the                       resistor to the battery's negative                       end.                      4.

Push-button/ switch                         Push-buttons and switches work on a                        simple electric mechanism to activate or                        deactivate the circuit When pressed.

If so, then you've experienced force.                     Force happens all around us, all of the time. Force is a push or a pull                    of an object that causes the object to speed up, slow down, or stay                    in one place. In other words, a force is what causes an object to                    move. Friction and gravity are two types of forces that inﬂuence                    how an object moves. Let's learn more about them.

Push and Pull Forces                    A push is the force that moves an object away from something, like                    when you push a plate of Brussels sprouts away in disgust. We use                    the force of push when we kick a soccer ball, press the gas peddle                    of a car, push our chair in, and press the buttons on a phone.                      A push and a pull are                    opposite forces,                    meaning they move                    objects in different                    directions. Therefore, a                    pull is the force of                    bringing an object                    closer. We use the force                                                   Ball changes direction                    of a pull when we move                    our bowl of ice cream                    closer to us, open a                    door, or climb up a                    rope.

Imagine                    trying to ride your bike through sand. Just thinking about this can                    make your legs burn from all the hard work. That is because the                    sand is a type of friction. In other words, it's a force working against                    your legs as they push against the peddles.

When a                    ball is thrown up in the air, it slows down and falls back to the                    ground.

With the right tools and skills, you can create                    anything you can imagine.                      Let’s start with Computer-aided                      design (CAD)                          First                      You have a set of 2D and 3D shapes can you recognize the                     difference.                      The main difference between 2D and 3D is the number of                     dimensions they have. 2D objects have two dimensions, length                     and width, while 3D objects have three dimensions, length, width,                     and height. This means that 2D objects can only be represented                     on a ﬂat surface, while 3D objects can be represented in a                     three-dimensional space.

Autodesk’s Tinkercad app is probably the easiest, most accessible                     and most fun 3D modeling application for creating your ﬁrst 3D                     print.

Let’s take a look on 3D printing process                     1.  Prepare your 3D model. Make sure that your 3D model is in a                       format that is compatible with your 3D printer.                      2.  Slice your 3D model. Once your 3D model is in the correct                       format, you need to slice it into layers.                      3.  Load your ﬁlament.  You need to load your ﬁlament into your 3D                       printer. The type of ﬁlament you use will depend on the                       properties of your 3D model.                        Note: Filaments used in 3D printing are thermoplastics, which are                    plastics that melt rather than burn when heated, can be shaped                    and molded, and solidify when cooled.

Once your ﬁlament is loaded, you can start                       printing your model.                      5.  Remove your model. Once the printing process is complete, you                       can remove your model from the 3D printer. It is important to                       let your model cool down completely before you try to remove                       it.                       6.  Finish your model. Once your model is cool, you can ﬁnish it by                       sanding it, painting it, or adding other decorations.

In DC, the electrons ow steadily in a single direction,                     while electrons keep switching directions, going forward                    and then backwards in AC.

The alternating current is one type of Electric current that                    changes its magnitude and polarity at regular intervals of time                    (periodically).                      When the load Resistor (R) is connected to an alternating current                    source, then the current start ﬂowing through it. At ﬁrst the                    current ﬂows in one direction, then it ﬂows in the opposite                    direction, it happens periodically.

In other words, we can say that Alternating current is the ﬂow of                    Electric charge (Electrons) through a conductor which changes                    direction periodically. Since the current ﬂow changes the direction                    periodically, therefore the voltage polarity also changes with it. It                    means the high potential (+) and low potential (-) swaps together.                    When an alternating current passes through a conductor(wire),                    the electrons of the conductor ﬁrst ﬂow in one direction, then it                    ﬂows in the opposite direction, this happens periodically.                    For example, the mains line voltage supply of Egypt is about 220                    volts, it has a frequency of 50Hz, which means the current                    changes direction 50 times a second.

The wave shape or waveform is a graph that represents the                    amplitude change of an alternating current/voltage with respect                    to the time period, where the amplitude of alternating current and                    voltage is taken along the y-axis of the graph and the time period                    taken along the x-axis. The amplitude of the alternating                    current/voltage oscillates between its maximum peak point and                    its minimum peak point along with a common reference point.

Thanks to the gearbox inside the car.                                           What are the gears?                    Gears are mechanisms that mesh together via teeth and are used                    to transmit rotary motion from one shaft to another. Geared                    devices can change the speed, torque, and direction of a power                    source.                      Gears are deﬁned by two important items: radius and number of                    teeth. They are typically mounted, or connected to other parts, via                    a shaft or base.                                          When a large gear is connected with a small one, the smaller gear                    will rotate faster than the bigger one. Turning the big gear slowly                    will require less energy than it would rotate the small one quickly;                    so, by using gear, there is saving of energy and making work                    easier.

Rotational velocity                        is the velocity of an object rotating around an axis.                        Torque                        is a rotating force produced by a motor. The more torque                        the motor produces, the greater is its ability to perform                        work                       Power                         is how rapidly work is accomplished.                        Power equals rotational velocity multiplied by the torque                         So, the power-driven to any of                    the gears is either translated to                    torque or rotational velocity.                     when two gears mesh together,                    power is applied to one of them                    and thus transmitted to the                    other.                      the bigger gear will translate this power to large torque at the                    expense of the speed (high torque low speed), while the smaller                    gear will translate such power to high speed and low torque.                       That's why cars need gearboxes. To begin with, a car needs a huge amount of                    force and very little speed to get it moving, so the driver uses the biggest gear.                     Once the car's going, the driver switches to a smaller gear. More of the engine's                    power switches to making speed and the car goes faster.                     The driver uses the gearshift to make the engine generate more force or more                    speed depending on whether hill-climbing power, acceleration from a standstill,                    or pure speed is needed.

In practice, changing gears means meshing different sized gear                    wheels together, but you can't do that while the gearbox is                    transmitting power from the engine at high speed.                     That's why you need to press a car's clutch pedal before changing                    gears, which disengages the engine's input from the gearbox.                                            The gear-box inside the car has dierent types of gears                      Spur gears                     spur gears are a type of cylindrical gear, with shafts that are                    parallel, and teeth that are straight and oriented parallel to the                    shafts. They’re the simplest and most common type of gear – easy                    to manufacture and suitable for a wide range of applications. The                    spur gears are typically used for lower-speed applications,                    although they can be used at almost any speed.

Worm gear                      A worm gear is a gear consisting of a                    shaft with a spiral thread that engages                    with and drives a toothed wheel.                      It changes the rotational movement by                    90 degrees.                         Bevel gear                     Bevel gears are gears where the axes of                    the two shafts intersect.                      Bevel gears are most often mounted on                    shafts that are 90 degrees apart but can                    be designed to work at other angles as                    well.                        Rack and pinion gears                     A rack and pinion are a type of linear                    actuator that comprises a circular gear                    engaging a linear gear, which operates                    to translate rotational motion into linear                    motion.                      Driving the pinion into rotation causes                    the rack to be driven linearly. Driving                    the rack linearly will cause the pinion to                    be driven into a rotation.                                                                                 https://www.youtube.                                                                              com/watch?v=edZnq                                                                              d638-w                                                                                                   Scan Here!
