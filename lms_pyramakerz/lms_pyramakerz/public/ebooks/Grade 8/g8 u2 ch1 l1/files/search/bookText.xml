             Watch the video and refer to the link to understand how the
             colour sensor detects and outputs RGB values.


             Observe and record the RGB ranges for at least ve colours as
             shown in the experiment.


             Fill in the table with the Red (R), Green (G), and Blue (B) values
             for each colour.
