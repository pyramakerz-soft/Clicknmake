Project Overview                 Project Overview                      Adam and Laila's school organized a eld trip to an industrial                 area where they visited one of the factories.                   The candy factory has been experiencing a serious problem in                 the sorting department.                    The color sorter machine,                 which is responsible for                 separating dierent                 colored candies into their                 respective bins, has been                 malfunctioning.                   As a result, candies of                  various colors are getting                 mixed up, causing                 confusion and frustration                 for the workers. Adam                 and Laila realized that                 this was a problem that                 could be solved with                 colors sorting system.                                                                      02","Learning Objectives                    By the end of the theme student will be able to:                        Select Optimal Cam Type.                       Identify the best belt type for your system.                       Research and apply methods to prevent jams.                      Ensure smooth object ow through the system.                       Identify Belt Drive Components: Recognize pulleys, shafts, and belts.                       Create conveyors and bins for sorting.                       Accurately build the sorting system.                      Design linkages to control sorting arms or gates.                       Connect a color sensor to an electrical circuit.                       Connect and synchronize multiple servo motors.                       Test and ne-tune the color sensor.                      Congure the circuit to power and sync servos.                       Understand and apply new functions and loops.                       Connect sensor input to servo motor output.                       Integrate Arduino with Python: Interface Arduino with Python for control.                       Project Task:                  Use the Engineering Design                Process to help Adam and Laila                identify the damaged part of the                machine and determine how to                x it.                                                                              03"];
