Why: The city wants to create a fun and exciting space for families,                    encouraging physical activity and enjoyment while enhancing the                    quality of life for residents.                                                                         03","Driving Question                   How can we plan, design, and build an amusement park that                  incorporates thrilling attractions, eective operational strategies,                  and cutting-edge technology, while meeting the needs of the                  community?                   Objectives/Goals                   1.  Understand the key elements of amusement parks: rides, attractions, services, safety,                      and target audience.                   2.  Learn the basics of entrepreneurship: business planning, investment, marketing, and risk                      management.                  3.  Understand the fundamentals of motion (speed, velocity, acceleration) as they apply to                      ride designs.                  4.  Apply Newton’s laws of motion and analyze forces (gravity, friction, centripetal force) in                      the context of amusement rides.                  5.  Explore the principles of energy (kinetic, potential) and their applications in amusement                      ride design.                  6.  Integrate motor drivers, DC motors, and other technologies to create operational systems                      for the rides.                  7.  Implement user controls, such as joysticks or touch screens, for interactive elements                      within the park.                  8.  Develop a website and mobile app to provide information about the amusement park, its                      attractions, and special events.                    Your Challenge                    By the end of this project, you’ll have:                    Designed a fully operational amusement park that includes a range                    of rides and attractions.                    Applied physics principles to ensure your rides are both thrilling and                    safe, considering motion, forces, and energy.                    Developed a business plan that outlines how the park will operate,                    attract visitors, and manage nances.                    Built and tested a prototype ride using motors, sensors, and control                    systems.                    Created a website and mobile app that promote the park, oering                    information on attractions, ticket prices, and upcoming events.                    Collaborated in teams as engineers, designers, and entrepreneurs to                    complete the project.                    Presented your park concept to a panel (teachers/peers) and                    explained how it meets community needs and expectations.                                                                  04"];
